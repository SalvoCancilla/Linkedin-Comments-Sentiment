1,"«lo spooner può prendersi tutto il tempo di cui ha bisogno, entro limiti ragionevoli, in aggiunta ai requisiti di legge», si legge nella nuova policy di bending spoons, la società milanese che sviluppa app. fiducia, rispetto e aiuto, dunque: permessi illimitati (retribuiti al 100 per cento sia per quanto riguarda la parte fissa che variabile) e doppio bonus da 10 mila euro per accogliere i figli dei dipendenti, così da permettere loro di pagare il nido o la babysitter. obiettivo, spiega l’hr manager a raffaele ricciardi su repubblica, è che «ognuno abbia le migliori possibilità di realizzare il sogno di creare una famiglia e di progredire nella propria carriera senza trovarsi costretto a fare rinunce esagerate. invece di essere sottoposti ad approvazioni preventive e controlli, i collaboratori sono invitati a decidere in autonomia quali benefit sfruttare, quando e come, sapendo che possono contare sul fatto che bending spoons li supporterà nelle loro decisioni, fornendo le necessarie risorse». “impossibile. maybe”, scrive l’azienda in un post sul profilo aziendale di linkedin ✔","«The spooner can take all the time he needs, within reasonable limits, in addition to the legal requirements», reads the new policy of bending spoons, the Milanese company that develops apps. trust, respect and help, therefore: unlimited leave (paid at 100 per cent for both the fixed and variable part) and a double bonus of 10,000 euros to welcome the children of employees, so as to allow them to pay for nursery school or babysitter. The objective, explains the HR manager to Raffaele Ricciardi in Repubblica, is that «everyone has the best chance of realizing the dream of starting a family and progressing in one's career without being forced to make exaggerated sacrifices. instead of being subjected to prior approvals and checks, collaborators are invited to decide independently which benefits to exploit, when and how, knowing that they can count on the fact that bending spoons will support them in their decisions, providing the necessary resources». ""impossible. maybe”, writes the company in a post on the linkedin company profile ✔"

5,ma quand'è che questo posto è diventato il nuovo facebook per i boomer?,but when did this place become the new facebook for boomers?
6,"andrea crocco buongiorno andrea. nessuna ""invidia sociale"" ( di che?) provi a vedere ( e comprendere) quello che ho affermato dall'inizio della discussione : definire illimitato qualcosa che il limite ha ( e che sara' deciso arbitrariamente da una delle due parti, giocoforza) e' dire una cosa non vera. ho lavorato anche io in organizzazioni in cui la fiducia era la base e la flessibilita' era la norma. ma quando si parla di rapporto di lavoro contrattualizzato non si puo' prescindere dalla chiarezza dei limiti in cui operare ( a tutela dei legittimi diritti delle due parti e per evitare contenziosi). questo e' quello che affermo dall'inizio entrando nel merito della questione nel post. siete voi che  divagate, sforando in attacchi alla persona. e questo e' quanto. prima di scrivere, leggete.","andrea crocco good morning andrea. no ""social envy"" (for what?) try to see (and understand) what I said at the beginning of the discussion: define something that the limit has as unlimited (and which will be decided arbitrarily by one of the two parties, of course) and ' say something that is not true. I have also worked in organizations where trust was the foundation and flexibility was the norm. but when it comes to a contractual employment relationship, one cannot ignore the clarity of the limits in which to operate (to protect the legitimate rights of the two parties and to avoid disputes). this is what I say from the beginning entering into the merits of the issue in the post. it is you who ramble, venturing into attacks on the person. and that's it. before writing, read."
7,"lei continua a ripetere a pappagallo la sua visione novecentesca del rapporto di lavoro.

e lo denota il fatto che il suo punto dirimente è il contenzioso, figlio di una visione che deve contrapporre lavoratore e datore di lavoro sul piano del cavillo legale.

altre forme di inquadrare il rapporto di lavoro esistono, e funzionano. in aziende capital intensive, soprattutto se parliamo di human capital, ad alto valore aggiunto ha perfettamente senso, oltretutto.

siamo nel 2023, non nel 1917.","she keeps parroting her twentieth-century view of the employment relationship.

and she denotes this by the fact that her decisive point is litigation, the son of a vision that must oppose worker and employer on the level of legal technicality.

other forms of framing the employment relationship exist, and they work. in capital intensive companies, especially if we are talking about human capital, with high added value it makes perfect sense, moreover.

we are in 2023, not 1917."
8,"sono venuta a conoscenza di questa società ieri, leggendo un altro post e sbirciando nella loro homepage sembra un bel ambiente lavorativo. mi viene voglia di trasferirmi a milano….","I learned about this company yesterday, reading another post and peeping into their homepage it looks like a nice working environment. I feel like moving to Milan…."
9,"non credo sia necessario, ho fatto dei colloqui con loro l'anno scorso e avrei potuto lavorare anche dall'estero senza problemi.","I don't think it's necessary, I interviewed them last year and I could have worked from abroad without any problems."
10,"e, di grazia, i ""limiti ragionevoli"" chi li stabilisce? ","and, pray tell, who establishes the ""reasonable limits""?"
11,"secondo me in un ambiente in cui c'è fiducia e rispetto il ""ragionevole"" è abbastanza condiviso. ad esempio è ragionevole finché il mio lavoro non deve essere fatto da altri e finché raggiungo gli obiettivi.","in my opinion, in an environment where there is trust and respect, the ""reasonable"" is fairly shared. for example it is reasonable as long as my work does not have to be done by others and as long as I achieve the objectives."
12,"matteo tausel quindi, il fatto e' ( e resta ) io ti dico : hai tutta la torta a disposizione ( senza limiti). ma prendi solo quello che e' ""ragionevole"". 😂😂😂 anche io resto della mia : senza le cose chiare, decide il piu' forte quello che e' ""ragionevole"" e quello che non lo e'. semplice.","matteo tausel therefore, the fact is (and remains) i tell you: you have all the cake available (without limits). but take only what is ""reasonable"". 😂😂😂 I too remain mine: without clear things, the strongest decides what is ""reasonable"" and what is not. simple."
13,certo che ci vuole coraggio a criticare le scelte di un’azienda e non saper manco scrivere in italiano corretto…,of course it takes courage to criticize the choices of a company and not even know how to write in correct Italian…
14,"@giuseppe cacioppo  grazie giuseppe. per carita' : pigrizia mia da tastiera smartphone l'utilizzo dell' apostrofo invece dell'accento ( non e' che non conosca la differenza). per quanto alle altre ""finezze' (come contare gli spazi...😂) o l'utilizzo ""improprio"" del termine ""cosa"" lascio giudicare ai lettori. per quanto mi riguarda, il sottolineare queste ""gravissime mancanze"" lo lascio fare a chi ha evdente necessitã di elevarsi abbassando gli altri ( o, almeno, provandoci). non credevo di avere a che fare con l'accademia della crusca : avrei dato una ripassata al sussidiario...😂 . comunque lascio a chi preferisce guardare il dito per non vedere la luna, per l'appunto, il dito : medio. 😂","@giuseppe cacioppo thanks giuseppe. for heaven's sake: my smartphone keyboard laziness using the apostrophe instead of the accent (it's not that I don't know the difference). as for the other ""niceties"" (like counting the spaces...😂) or the ""improper"" use of the term ""thing"" I leave it to the readers to judge. As far as I'm concerned, I leave it to myself to underline these ""very serious shortcomings"" those who clearly need to raise themselves by lowering the others (or, at least, by trying). I didn't think I had to do with the bran academy: I would have given the subsidiary a go over...😂 . anyway I'll leave it to those who prefer to look at the finger to not see the moon, precisely, the finger: middle. 😂"
15,"matteo tausel e quindi gli ""statuti ben scritti"" indicheranno anche i limiti dei permessi? perche' : se si, non sono illimitati. se no non sono ""ben scritti"" e quindi, si prestano ad abusi da parte dell""azienda : ""ti concedo quello che voglio io"" e' differente ( molto) da ""illimitato"".","matteo tausel and therefore the ""well written statutes"" will also indicate the limits of the permits? why: if yes, they are not unlimited. otherwise they are not ""well written"" and therefore, they lend themselves to abuse by the company: ""I'll give you what I want"" is (very) different from ""unlimited""."
16,"credo che lei non abbia ben chiaro il concetto di ragionevolezza allora, perché in questo caso è fondamentale.

comunque allora mettiamola giù semplice: avere ferie illimitate è una cosa fantastica, però stai comunque lavorando per quest'azienda. se ti prendi tutto l'anno di ferie non produci nulla, quindi verrai licenziato per ragioni di produttività ergo è colpa tua.
mettiamo caso che raggiungi l'80% dei tuoi obiettivi e ti prendi comunque una valanga di ferie, è ragionevole che l'azienda ti dica che non va bene.
mettiamo caso che raggiungi il 100% e prendi una valanga di ferie, te lo sei meritato, probabilmente non verrai proattivamente preso in considerazione per delle promozioni.

queste banali sfumature spesso si risolvono con una conversazione fatta con ragionevolezza, visto che un'azienda che permette tante libertà non è un'azienda stupida come nel passato che mette il fiato sul collo dei dipendenti e li monitora come il miglior micromanager, ma un'azienda che lascia tante libertà a professionisti di alto livello e chiede in cambio serietà e collaborazione.

credo di essermi spiegato, altri dubbi?","I think you don't quite understand the concept of reasonableness then, because in this case it is fundamental.

anyway then let's put it simply: having unlimited holidays is a fantastic thing, but you're still working for this company. if you take the whole year off you don't produce anything, so you'll be fired for productivity reasons, so it's your fault.
let's say you hit 80% of your goals and still take tons of time off, it's reasonable for the company to tell you it's not okay.
let's say you hit 100% and take tons of time off, you deserve it, you probably won't be proactively considered for promotions.

these trivial nuances are often resolved with a reasonable conversation, given that a company that allows so many freedoms is not a stupid company like in the past that breathes down its employees' necks and monitors them like the best micromanager, but a a company that leaves many freedoms to high-level professionals and asks for seriousness and collaboration in return.

I think I explained myself, any other questions?"
17,"cominciamo dal significato della parola ""bending spoon"" può essere interpretato in diversi modi a seconda del contesto. è presente, una possibile interpretazione ed è quella legata al fenomeno della psicocinesi o telecinesi, che consiste nella capacità di manipolare oggetti con la sola forza del pensiero.
nel film ""matrix"", ad esempio, il personaggio di spoon boy afferma che ""non è il cucchiaio che si piega, è solo la tua mente"". questa frase è stata interpretata come un riferimento alla capacità di manipolare la realtà attraverso il potere della mente. in generale, ""bending spoon"" può essere visto come una metafora per indicare la capacità di superare le limitazioni imposte dalla realtà e di creare nuove possibilità attraverso la propria forza di volontà e immaginazione. (le famose start up)","let's start with the meaning of the word ""bending spoon"" can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. there is a possible interpretation and it is the one linked to the phenomenon of psychokinesis or telekinesis, which consists in the ability to manipulate objects with the sole power of thought.
in the movie ""matrix"", for example, the spoon boy character states that ""it's not the spoon that bends, it's just your mind"". this phrase has been interpreted as a reference to the ability to manipulate reality through the power of the mind. in general, ""bending spoon"" can be seen as a metaphor to indicate the ability to overcome the limitations imposed by reality and to create new possibilities through one's willpower and imagination. (the famous startups)"
18,"bernardo cavalli okkei. grazie per la puntualizzazione grammaticale. ora, riguardo a quanto i contenuti? lei accetterebbe di sottoscrivere un contratto in cui la controparte pagherebbe una sua prestazione professionale in modo ""ragionevole""? o pretenderebbe di indicare una quantita' di denaro? questo e' il concetto che io sottolineo. poi, certamente, un rapporto di lavoro e' un rapporto che si basa sulla fiducia reciproca ( altrimenti ne decade il senso). ma indicare un criterio di valutazione tanto discutibile, significa certamente aprire a contenziosi continui. e, ri-sottolineo : illimitato, in italiano, significa senza limiti.","bernardo cavalli okkei. Thanks for the grammatical clarification. now, about how much content? Would you agree to sign a contract in which the other party would pay for your professional services in a ""reasonable"" way? or would it claim to indicate an amount of money? this is the concept that I emphasize. then, of course, an employment relationship is a relationship based on mutual trust (otherwise the meaning is lost). but indicating such a questionable evaluation criterion certainly means opening up to continuous disputes. and, I re-emphasize: unlimited, in Italian, means without limits."
19,"matteo tausel il concetto stesso di ""ragionevolezza"" e' sindacabile. quello che e' ""ragionevole"" per me non e' detto che lo sia per lei. quindi, resto della mia opinione. se non sono chiare, le regole le decide il piu' forte ed e' semplicissimo che scadano in abuso.semplice. dubbi?","matteo tausel the very concept of ""reasonableness"" is questionable. what is ""reasonable"" for me may not necessarily be reasonable for you. therefore, I remain of my opinion. if they are not clear, the rules are decided by the strongest and it is very simple that they expire in abuse. simple. doubts?"
20,"allora, divido la risposta in più punti.

situazione: io dico che le possibilità di più libertà offerte sono qualcosa di molto positivo, lei sta dicendo che rischiano di essere negative perché non propriamente regolamentate.

possibile soluzione: se si inserisce un minimo obbligatorio di ferie e permessi, ma non gli si pone un limite, si ha una situazione di mutua vittoria, il dipendente meritevole potrà godere di privilegi e il meno meritevole, ma comunque performante, potrà comunque avere i suoi diritti garantiti(esattamente ciò che intendevo con ""statuti ben scritti"" per la cronaca) ad esempio.

stato dell'arte: teniamo sempre a mente il fatto che in italia abbiamo una visione distorta in quanto i costi aziendali per avere un dipendente sono folli e le aziende vedono i dipendenti come un rischio elevato, perché dobbiamo sempre ricordare che gli imprenditori e le imprenditrici si prendono grandi rischi privati, quindi è anche giusto che abbiano del potere decisionale.

di dubbi non ne ho, vedo solo un professionista che vede in un benefit un rischio perché, mi pare, è stato abituato a pensare che se ti propongono una fetta di torta, probabilmente è avvelenata.

resto della mia idea 😉","So, I divide the answer into several points.

situation: I say that the possibilities of more freedom offered are something very positive, you are saying that they risk being negative because they are not properly regulated.

possible solution: if a mandatory minimum of holidays and leave is inserted, but no limit is set, there is a situation of mutual victory, the deserving employee will be able to enjoy privileges and the least deserving, but still performing, will still be able to have the its guaranteed rights (exactly what I meant by ""well written statutes"" for the record) for example.

state of the art: we always keep in mind the fact that in Italy we have a distorted view as the business costs to have an employee are insane and companies see employees as a high risk, because we must always remember that entrepreneurs they take great private risks, so it is also right that they have decision-making power.

I have no doubts, I only see a professional who sees a risk in a benefit because, it seems to me, he has been used to thinking that if they offer you a slice of cake, it is probably poisoned.

rest of my idea 😉"

lastly, a group of rockstar angel investors – the founders of almost all of the major ongoing ecosystem success stories such as , , , , , , , etc. (you name them) – have come together to provide angel investment and possibly become the first jet hr clients.

25,"ciao marco, se i founders di jet hr e payfit condividono lo stesso padre, immagino che l'analogia tenga :) 

non ho dubbi sul fatto se state lanciando oggi ci sia un chiaro product-market fit. anche vero che la realta' italiana e' sempre molto difficile da interpretare/capire per stranieri, e sono sicuro che il vostro servizio sara' su misura delle particolarita' del paese (da li la mia domanda --> qual e' il competitive advantage vs gli altri?).
infine, quando dicevo che m'affascinano i copy-cat, era senza ironia - io stesso ho riflettuto sulle possibilita' di prendere un servizio di successo all'estero e riprodurlo in italia ... rocket ci ha fatto una fortuna sul concetto :)

in bocca al lupo per l'avventura!","hi marco, if the founders of jet hr and payfit share the same father, i guess the analogy holds :)

I have no doubt that if you're launching today there's a clear product-market fit. it is also true that the Italian reality is always very difficult to interpret/understand for foreigners, and I am sure that your service will be tailored to the particularities of the country (hence my question --> what is the competitive advantage vs the others?).
finally, when I said that copy-cats fascinate me, it was without irony - I myself reflected on the possibilities of taking a successful service abroad and reproducing it in Italy ... rocket made us a fortune on the concept :)

good luck on the adventure!"

in , ai candidati che arrivano al colloquio in fase di selezione, ma poi non vengono scelti per entrare a far parte della società, viene chiesto un ente non profit a loro scelta a cui donare 10 euro.
             
in c’è un canale slack dedicato per celebrare insieme le varie festività delle diverse culture presenti in azienda, considerando che ci sono persone da 30 diversi paesi del mondo.

ecco...quando l’altro giorno una persona mi ha scritto in privato dicendomi che ormai non spera più di incontrare un’azienda interessata davvero a te come persona, più che come risorsa da usare e spremere a piacimento, ho subito pensato a queste 3 giovani aziende italiane e alle loro azioni concrete per le persone.

aziende che non hanno job title con scritto “hr” ma “people & culture”.

perché in azienda ci sono “persone” e non “risorse”.

in ci stiamo lavorando su questo, prendendo ispirazione proprio dalle aziende sopra menzionate.

il post di oggi è per dirti che esistono aziende che ti trattano come persone e non risorse. e queste qui sopra sono solo un esempio.

se vuoi seguirmi, scrivo ogni giorno un post con una gif:","in oneday groups (weroad, scuolazoo, together…) a bonus of 10,800 euros is given to employees who have a child (300 euros a month for 3 years), as well as the freedom to come to the office with the child and the total flexibility on the smartworking side.

in , candidates who arrive at the interview during the selection phase, but are then not chosen to join the company, are asked to donate 10 euros to a non-profit organization of their choice.
             
in there is a dedicated slack channel to celebrate together the various holidays of the different cultures present in the company, considering that there are people from 30 different countries of the world.

here... when the other day a person wrote to me privately telling me that he no longer hopes to meet a company that is truly interested in you as a person, rather than as a resource to be used and squeezed at will, I immediately thought of these 3 young Italian companies and their concrete actions for people.

companies that do not have a job title with the word ""hr"" but ""people & culture"".

because in the company there are ""people"" and not ""resources"".

in we are working on this, taking inspiration from the companies mentioned above.

today's post is to tell you that there are companies that treat you as people and not resources. and these above are just an example.

if you want to follow me, I write a post every day with a gif:"

in queste organizzazioni il trust index verso i propri leader é del 95%. credo sia un dato straordinario, frutto di un lavoro accurato di costruzione, aderenza a valori forti e ascolto autentico dei bisogni della proprie persone, ed è un benchmark utile per lavorare sulla propria organizzazione.

quest’anno ben 31 aziende su 60 in classifica sono italiane; 10 anni fa erano solo 8 su 35.
complimenti a tutte!


italia","today I am pleased to point out the new ranking «best workplaces italy 2023» to talk about some characteristics that strongly emerge in organizations attentive to people. meritocracy, fairness and parental support policies are the three key elements that contribute to making people happy in their workplace.

in these organizations the trust index towards their leaders is 95%. I think it is an extraordinary figure, the result of careful construction work, adherence to strong values ​​and authentic listening to the needs of one's people, and it is a useful benchmark for working on one's organization.

this year, 31 out of 60 companies in the rankings are Italian; 10 years ago it was only 8 out of 35.

232,"cerco sempre di non arrabbiarmi, ma leggendo questo articolo di engadget mi sono inalberato non poco



sintesi:
- era un pioniere nel mondo delle note/appunti digitali, ha raccolto oltre 300m$ nella sua vita e, al picco, valeva oltre 1b$
- poi perde focus, si allontana dal core, cambia mille ceo… quindi si perde per strada, perde valore, viene surclassata da altre startup più focalizzate
- oggi l’annuncio che viene comprata da , che il giornalista di engadget (la cui conoscenza del mondo del tech evidentemente finisce sul fuso orario di new york) ignora
- il giornalista chiude dubitando che i suoi dati siano sicuri (qualcuno gli spieghi come funziona il nostro gdpr rispetto a quello americano così capisce il concetto di privacy), dubitando che questa mossa possa beneficiare chi, come lui, è utente innamorato (e con lock-in autoinfliitto notevole direi) della app e dubitando che una core feature come la sincronizzazione sarà garantita (non so che app ha usato finora, ma evernote oggi è tutt’altro che best in class in questo).
- e afferma, quasi con scherno, che essere comprati da una “piccola” italiana è un segno di fallimento rispetto ad essere comprati da una big tech

bene, questo articolo è il trionfo dell’america-centrismo che dilaga nel tech.

vi dico cosa penso io invece
1- kudos a bending spoons che ha avuto coraggio e risorse per andare nella tana del leone (la silicon valley) a comprare un’azienda in evidente difficoltà su stack, tecnologico, prodotto e marketing
2- kudos a tutto quello che ha fatto bending spoons in passato per arrivare anache solo a permettersi il lusso di valutare un’operazione del genere
3- non solo io credo che evernote si riprenderà (ora) ma che, con le competenze di bending spoons possa tornare a giorcarsela coi notion di turno che, negli ultimi anni, l’hanno oscurata
4- se l’avesse comprata una “big tech”, caro amico americano, l’avrebbero chiusa in 1 anno e le tue amate note avresti dovuto esportarle in un feed xml e importarle a mano da un’altra parte con meno di un mese di preavviso.

e a tutti dico: occhio. noi italiani siamo bravi a complicarci la vita con leggi, burocrazia, invidie… ma siamo maledettamente resilienti, creativi e talentuosi e se ci mettiamo in testa qualcosa (come ad esempio prendere 3 barche da palos e andare a ovest a vedere cosa troviamo) non ci ferma nessuno.

bravi bending spoons, spero davvero che quello che farete con evernote possa essere da lezione a tutti.
agli americani ma anche a tante aziende italiane che magari hanno le risorse e il talento che avete voi ma che non hanno il coraggio di giocarsela a quel livello. oggi avete dimostrato che si può fare e l’italia ha un bisogno disperato di stimoli come questo.
grazie!","I always try not to get angry, but reading this engadget article made me angry



synthesis:
- was a pioneer in the world of digital notes, raised over $300m in his lifetime and was worth over $1b at peak
- then it loses focus, moves away from the core, changes a thousand CEOs... then gets lost along the way, loses value, is outclassed by other more focused startups
- today the announcement that it is bought by , which the engadget journalist (whose knowledge of the tech world evidently ends up in the new york time zone) ignores
- the journalist closes doubting that his data is safe (someone explain to him how our gdpr works compared to the American one so he understands the concept of privacy), doubting that this move could benefit those who, like him, are users in love (and with lock -in remarkable self-infliction I'd say) of the app and doubting that a core feature like sync will be guaranteed (I don't know what app he's used so far, but evernote today is far from best in class in this).
- and states, almost mockingly, that being bought by a ""small"" Italian is a sign of failure compared to being bought by a big tech

well, this article is the triumph of america-centrism that is rampant in tech.

I tell you what I think instead
1- kudos a bending spoons who had the courage and resources to go into the lion's den (silicon valley) to buy a company in evident difficulty in terms of stack, technology, product and marketing
2- kudos to everything that has done bending spoons in the past to even afford the luxury of evaluating such an operation
3- not only do I believe that evernote will recover (now) but that, with the skills of bending spoons, it can go back to playing with the notions on duty who, in recent years, have overshadowed it
4- if a ""big tech"" had bought it, dear American friend, they would have closed it in 1 year and your beloved notes you would have had to export them in an xml feed and import them by hand from elsewhere with less than a month of notice.

and to everyone I say: watch out. we Italians are good at complicating our lives with laws, bureaucracy, envy... but we are bloody resilient, creative and talented and if we put something into our heads (such as taking 3 boats from Palos and going west to see what we find) we won't stop nobody.

good bending spoons, I really hope that what you do with evernote can be a lesson to everyone.
to the Americans but also to many Italian companies that may have the resources and talent that you have but who don't have the courage to play it at that level. today you have shown that it can be done and Italy is in desperate need of stimuli like this.
Thank you!"

241,"grazie riccardo porta per aver condiviso la classifica e aver suscitato discussione. vi racconto un po' la nostra esperienza. per noi il gptw rappresenta un test fatto da un ente terzo per misurare tutti gli sforzi che facciamo in talent retention. l'obiettivo è misurare se stiamo facendo gli sforzi giusti allo scopo di avere un team coeso, motivato e che lavori bene. e' un po' come quando studi molto e poi fai l'esame alla fine del semestre. a onor del vero l'investimento è davvero alla portata e noi abbiamo scelto di farlo per avere un misuratore esterno che certificasse gli sforzi. chiaramente ci sono moltissime realtà, anche migliori di noi in talent retention che non fanno parte di questa lista, magari perchè non lo ritengono uno strumento utile nel loro contesto e ci più stare. quanto a salesforce, concordo che sia ""strano"" vederla in classifica, ma credo che il layoff sia arrivato dopo la rilevazione del test altrimenti sarebbe effettivamente strano. vedremo il prossimo anno se si piazzerà ancora. :)","Thank you Riccardo Porta for sharing the rankings and sparking discussion. I'll tell you a little about our experience. for us the gptw represents a test carried out by a third party to measure all the efforts we make in talent retention. the objective is to measure whether we are making the right efforts in order to have a cohesive, motivated and well-working team. it's a bit like when you study a lot and then take the exam at the end of the semester. to be honest, the investment is really within reach and we have chosen to do it to have an external measurer that certifies the efforts. clearly there are many realities, even better than us in talent retention that are not part of this list, perhaps because they do not consider it a useful tool in their context and are no longer there. as for salesforce, i agree that it is ""strange"" to see it in the standings, but i think the layoff came after the test was taken, otherwise it would be really strange. we will see next year if it will place again. :)"

non è la prima volta e non sarà sicuramente l'ultima che condivido un post per complimentarmi con e tutto il loro team.

mentre in italia spesso si guarda a modelli classici come e-commerce e ads, bending spoons sta dimostrando come anche una realtà italiana con la giusta esecuzione possa dominare nel mercato digitale mondiale.

bending ha infatti acquisito , un colosso da 250 milioni di utenti nel mondo, 100 milioni di fatturato e 350 dipendenti.

qual è la cosa più incredibile di questa acquisizione secondo me? la coerenza con il loro modello.

quasi tutti i prodotti di bending non sono stati creati in casa, ma acquisiti e fatti crescere esattamente come faranno con evernote.

bending sa bene che la loro forza è nello scalare realtà che hanno già superato il pmf (product market-fit), un modello che mi ricorda tanto rocket internet dove ho lavorato in passato.

complimenti ancora a tutto il team di bending a cui dovremmo tutti ispirarci 👏👏👏👏","bending spoons acquires evernote 💯💯

It's not the first time and it definitely won't be the last that I share a post to compliment them and their entire team.

while in Italy we often look at classic models such as e-commerce and ads, bending spoons is demonstrating how even an Italian company with the right execution can dominate the global digital market.

bending has in fact acquired , a giant with 250 million users worldwide, 100 million turnover and 350 employees.

What is the most amazing thing about this acquisition in my opinion? consistency with their model.

almost all bending products were not created in house, but acquired and grown exactly as they will with evernote.

298,"ho finito gli aggettivi per descrivere #bendingspoons.
sono il più grande orgoglio e faro guida del nostro ecosistema.

un' di cui dobbiamo andare fieri (stendiamo un velo pietoso su come sono stati trattati quando hanno sviluppato, gratis, a servizio dell'italia la app ), un esempio per tutti gli che voglio costruire qualcosa di grande mossi da principi di perfezione, efficienza ed etica.

una storia bellissima che riscrivere la narrativa dell'italiano che deve spostarsi all'estero per avere successo: i 4 co-founders (italiani) infatti dalla danimarca dove avevano studiato e lanciato la loro prima azienda decidono di creare a l'hq di bending spoons e qui oggi danno da lavorare a centinaia di ragazzi, tutti eccellenti, offrendo loro un ambiente di lavoro, pacchetti retributivi e di welfare paragonabili a quelli della .

ed è proprio negli che oggi segnano un nuovo colpo che alza ancora più in alto la barra della storia che stanno scrivendo. una scale up italiana che acquisisce una delle più famose realtà digitali globali: .
250m di utenti nel mondo, 100m di fatturato, 350 dipendenti, una valutazione che era arrivata oltre il miliardo di euro... che spettacolo di acquisizione!!

che orgoglio, che sprono a far tutti del nostro meglio per far si che non resti un caso di eccellenza isolato. rimbocchiamoci tutti le maniche, guardiamo un po' meno serie tv, leggiamo un po' meno giornali, portatori solo che di brutte notizie, e impegniamoci per tirare fuori il bello e il potenziale che c'è in ognuno di noi e in ogni nostra azienda.

grazie amici di bending, siete un esempio!
e ora al lavoro.","I ran out of adjectives to describe #bendingspoons.
they are the greatest pride and guiding light of our ecosystem.

one of which we must be proud (let's spread a pitiful veil on how they were treated when they developed the app, free of charge, at the service of Italy), an example for all those who want to build something great moved by principles of perfection, efficiency and ethics.

a beautiful story that rewrites the narrative of the Italian who has to move abroad to be successful: the 4 co-founders (Italians) in fact from Denmark where they had studied and launched their first company decide to create bending spoons at the HQ and here today they give work to hundreds of young people, all of them excellent, offering them a working environment, salary and welfare packages comparable to those of .

and it is precisely in the islands that today they score a new blow that raises the bar of the story they are writing even higher. an Italian scale-up that acquires one of the most famous global digital companies: .
250m of users worldwide, 100m of turnover, 350 employees, a valuation that had reached over one billion euros... what a spectacular acquisition!!

what pride, what a spur to all of us to do our best to ensure that it does not remain an isolated case of excellence. let's all roll up our sleeves, watch a little less TV series, read a little less newspapers, bearers of bad news only, and let's commit ourselves to bring out the beauty and potential that is in each of us and in each of our companies .

thanks friends of bending, you are an example!
and now to work."
299,"a prescindere dal fatto che evernote sia ancora usato o no, whatever.. mi sembra assurdo vedere italiani che anche davanti a notizie come questa devono odiare/rosicare/avere da ridire/fare polemica. cioè neanche in grado di sostenere una delle migliori aziende locali, sono veramente amareggiato :(
riflessioni a parte, complimenti!","regardless of whether evernote is still used or not, whatever.. it seems absurd to me to see Italians who, even in the face of news like this, have to hate/gnaw/have objections/argue. i.e. not even able to support one of the best local companies, I'm really saddened :(
reflections aside, congratulations!"

301,"marco caradonna bravo. e allora perche’ blacksheep ventures ha investito in una startup lettone? no davvero, forse e’ arrivato il momento che la gente non posti commenti a caso e si renda conto a chi si sta rivolgendo. combatto da anni una battaglia contro gli esterofili e seguo centinaia di startup dal 2013. assito venture capital e acceleratori storici e anche alcuni dei saggi che hanno contribuito alla nascita del dl 179/2012 quindi diciamo che qualcosa in materia di startup la so. non credo che la materia riguardi bending che ovviamente non e’ startup innovativa per cui il tuo intervento non credo sia rilevante. pero’ se vuoi apriamo un dibattito sull’innovazione “per tabula” certificata dalle camere di commercio. invece il tema fiscale su cui ti vedo preparato, e’ sicuramente interessante (anche se forse piu’ per investitori e acceleratori). insomma il tuo commento non risponde alla mia critica pero’ apre spunti interessanti. pero’ parliamo anche della gestione del contenzioso, dei notai, delle regole societarie. perche’ un dibattito serio si fa affrontando la questione a 360 gradi e dopo avere studiato e lavorato anni nel settore.","marco caradonna bravo. so why did blacksheep ventures invest in a latvian startup? no really, maybe it's time for people not to post random comments and realize who they are addressing. I have been fighting a battle against xenophiles for years and have been following hundreds of startups since 2013. I have been involved in venture capital and historic accelerators and also some of the wise men who contributed to the birth of Legislative Decree 179/2012 so let's say that I know something about startups. I don't think the matter concerns bending which obviously isn't an innovative startup so I don't think your intervention is relevant. but if you want we can open a debate on innovation ""per tabula"" certified by the chambers of commerce. instead the tax issue on which I see you prepared is certainly interesting (although perhaps more for investors and accelerators). In short, your comment does not respond to my criticism but it opens up interesting ideas. but we also talk about the management of disputes, notaries, company rules. because a serious debate is made by tackling the issue at 360 degrees and after having studied and worked in the sector for years."

352,"ho letto questa notizia e sono saltato sulla sedia.

sono anni che cerco di condividere le storie e difendere il fantastico lavoro che alcune aziende nate in italia svolgono con eccellenza.

tra queste sicuramente ho sempre ammirato bending spoons che è nata nel 2013 e si è fin da subito distinta nel campo dello sviluppo di applicazioni per dispositivi mobili.

la cosa brutta è che in italia, per molti, il suo nome è collegato ancora in maniera miope alla realizzazione dell'app immuni mentre all'estero è ormai una realtà considerata credibile e straordinaria.

con oltre 500 milioni di download delle sue app, e oltre 90 milioni di utenti attivi al mese, bending spoons è oggi infatti una delle realtà più importanti a livello globale nello sviluppo e commercializzazione di app per smartphone e una delle prime aziende tecnologiche in europa.

una cosa da strabuzzare gli occhi.

ora ha annunciato di aver raccolto 340 milioni di dollari di finanziamenti da investitori internazionali.

tra i finanziatori figurano star internazionali nei settori della tecnologia, dei media, dell’intrattenimento e dello sport, oltre a intesa sanpaolo, banco bpm, cherry bay capital e altri importanti gruppi bancari e fondi italiani e internazionali.

si tratta di una delle operazioni più importanti avvenute in italia negli ultimi anni nell’ambito tecnologico.

spero che grazie anche a questa notizia l'azienda raccolga ancora di più i plausi che, da sempre, merita.","I read this news and jumped on my chair.

I have been trying to share stories and defend the fantastic work that some Italian-born companies do with excellence for years.

among these I have certainly always admired bending spoons which was born in 2013 and immediately stood out in the field of developing applications for mobile devices.

the bad thing is that in Italy, for many, his name is still short-sightedly connected to the creation of the immune app, while abroad it is now a reality considered credible and extraordinary.

with over 500 million downloads of its apps, and over 90 million active users per month, bending spoons is today in fact one of the most important global players in the development and marketing of apps for smartphones and one of the leading technology companies in Europe.

an eye-rolling thing.

it has now announced that it has raised $340 million in financing from international investors.

Lenders include international stars in the technology, media, entertainment and sports sectors, as well as Intesa Sanpaolo, Banco BPM, Cherry Bay Capital and other major Italian and international banking groups and funds.

it is one of the most important operations that has taken place in Italy in recent years in the technological field.

I hope that thanks also to this news, the company will receive even more praise that it has always deserved."

409,"sono nella squadra humamy da poco più di 3 mesi. ecco 5 cose interessanti che ho scoperto in 100 giorni, dal nostro modo di mangiare all’industria alimentare, dalla cultura aziendale di bending spoons a due scoperte personali. fatemi sapere i vostri commenti!

1️⃣ 1 italiano su 2 ha dichiarato di essersi messo a dieta negli ultimi 3 anni, l’83% con metodi fai da te. in più, nel paese della dieta mediterranea, solo 1 su 2 sa descriverla e 1 su 10 la segue veramente (grazie e per i video, che consiglio). ecco, nel paese dove si mangia meglio al mondo, mi sembra di capire che abbiamo un rapporto con il cibo che può migliorare, oscillando spesso tra l’esagerazione e la privazione.

2️⃣ in italia circa il 60% dei cereali che produciamo vengono usati negli allevamenti di animali (fonte: our world in data). con questo non voglio dire che bisogna smettere di mangiare la carne. la mia domanda però è: in un epoca in cui la siccità è un problema grave e lo diventerà sempre di più, ha senso dedicare così tante risorse agli allevamenti?

3️⃣ perché bending spoons è da diversi anni top workplace d'italia? basta vivere l’ufficio per capirlo: l’atmosfera che si respira è giovane, stimolante ed energizzante.

4️⃣ appena entrato in humamy ho iniziato a gestire il servizio clienti (in una startup si fa tutto!). parlo con i clienti ogni giorno, li conosco e scopro come li stiamo aiutando. è un’attività che dubito farò per sempre, ma per conoscere a fondo il nostro target ha contribuito più di mille corsi di marketing.

5️⃣ il ritorno in ufficio dopo quasi due anni di full remote mi ha costretto a cambiare routine. come conseguenza ho scoperto una cosa pazzesca: fare sport ogni mattina prima di andare in ufficio mi fa sentire, pensare e lavorare meglio. perché ho atteso così tanto per capirlo?!","I've been on the humamy team for just over 3 months. here are 5 interesting things I discovered in 100 days, from our way of eating to the food industry, from the corporate culture of bending spoons to two personal discoveries. let me know your comments!

1️⃣ 1 out of 2 Italians said they have been on a diet in the last 3 years, 83% with do-it-yourself methods. moreover, in the country of the Mediterranean diet, only 1 out of 2 can describe it and 1 out of 10 really follows it (thanks and for the videos, which I recommend). here, in the country where you eat the best in the world, I understand that we have a relationship with food that can improve, often swinging between exaggeration and deprivation.

2️⃣ in Italy about 60% of the cereals we produce are used in animal farms (source: our world in data). with this I do not mean that we must stop eating meat. my question, however, is: in an era in which drought is a serious problem and will become more and more so, does it make sense to devote so many resources to livestock farming?

3️⃣ why has bending spoons been the top workplace in Italy for several years? it is enough to experience the office to understand it: the atmosphere you breathe is young, stimulating and energising.

4 ️ ⃣ as soon as I joined humamy I started managing customer service (everything is done in a startup!). I talk to clients every day, get to know them and find out how we are helping them. it is an activity that I doubt I will do forever, but more than a thousand marketing courses have contributed to getting to know our target in depth.

5️⃣ returning to the office after almost two years of full remote forced me to change my routine. as a result I discovered a crazy thing: playing sports every morning before going to the office makes me feel, think and work better. Why did I wait so long to figure this out?!"
410,humamy è stata per me una meravigliosa scoperta. ha risposto ad esigenze che avevo e sta contribuendo alla mia conoscenza e consapevolezza alimentare. non potrei più farne a meno. il fatto poi che sia una startup di giovani talenti mi piace tantissimo.,humamy was a wonderful discovery for me. she has responded to needs I had and is contributing to my food knowledge and awareness. I couldn't do without it anymore. I really like the fact that it's a startup of young talents.

420,"oggi ho avuto la fortuna di tornare alla mia università, la bocconi, invitato da emanuela prandelli, e condividere la mia esperienza con i giovani studenti. è stato un momento emozionante per me, mi sono trovato dall'altra parte con l'opportunità di parlare del mio percorso e delle lezioni che ho imparato nel corso degli anni tra phame, e .

uno dei temi che ho toccato è stato quello del fallimento, un tema che ho sempre affrontato con molta umiltà e apertura mentale. ho spiegato come, nonostante il fallimento possa essere un'esperienza dolorosa, sia anche un'occasione per imparare e crescere, acquisendo nuove competenze e capacità. in particolare, ho risposto a una domanda che mi ha colpito molto: ""come posso fare a mitigare la paura del fallimento?"".

purtroppo, in italia ancora oggi c'è lo stigma del fallimento, e molti ragazzi hanno paura di fallire per non essere giudicati dai loro coetanei, dai genitori, dagli insegnanti (valeva anche per me). tuttavia, il fallimento non deve essere visto come un'etichetta permanente, ma piuttosto come un'opportunità per imparare e crescere.
non c'è niente di sbagliato nel tentare un progetto e non riuscire, anzi: la volontà e il coraggio di provare a fare qualcosa sono già una grande qualità. e se il progetto non dovesse andare a buon fine, è importante capire cosa è andato storto e quali lezioni si possono trarre da questa esperienza.
personalmente, ho ""fallito"" molte volte nella mia vita professionale, ma ho sempre cercato di trarre il meglio da queste esperienze. infatti, molte delle lezioni più importanti che ho imparato sono state grazie ai miei errori.

se siete giovani imprenditori o studenti che vogliono lanciarsi in un progetto, vi invito a non avere timore di fallire. non abbiate paura di provarci, di sbagliare, di imparare e di crescere. sappiate che il fallimento non è un'etichetta permanente, ma solo un'esperienza che vi permetterà di imparare e migliorare.

se avete bisogno di un confronto o di un consiglio, per quel che può valere, la mia porta è aperta. e scommetto che ci sono tante altre persone come me, pronte ad aiutarvi e ad incoraggiarvi in questo percorso di crescita e successo.

l'italia ha bisogno di giovani imprenditori come voi e come me, quindi non abbiate paura di lanciarvi in questa avventura. daje!","today I was lucky enough to go back to my university, bocconi, invited by emanuela prandelli, and share my experience with young students. it was an exciting time for me, i found myself on the other side with the opportunity to talk about my journey and the lessons i learned over the years between phame, and .

one of the topics I touched upon was that of failure, a topic I have always approached with great humility and an open mind. I explained how, although failure can be a painful experience, it is also an opportunity to learn and grow, acquiring new skills and abilities. in particular, I answered a question that struck me a lot: ""how can I mitigate the fear of failure?"".

unfortunately, in Italy today there is still the stigma of failure, and many kids are afraid of failing so as not to be judged by their peers, parents, teachers (it was the same for me). however, failure should not be seen as a permanent label, but rather as an opportunity to learn and grow.
there's nothing wrong with attempting a project and failing, on the contrary: the will and the courage to try something is already a great quality. and if the project fails, it is important to understand what went wrong and what lessons can be learned from this experience.
personally, I've ""failed"" many times in my professional life, but I've always tried to make the best of these experiences. in fact, many of the most important lessons I've learned have been thanks to my mistakes.

if you are young entrepreneurs or students who want to embark on a project, I invite you not to be afraid of failing. don't be afraid to try, to make mistakes, to learn and to grow. know that failure is not a permanent label, but only an experience that will allow you to learn and improve.

if you need a discussion or advice, for what it's worth, my door is open. and I bet there are many other people like me, ready to help and encourage you in this path of growth and success.

Italy needs young entrepreneurs like you and me, so don't be afraid to embark on this adventure. come on!"

oggi siamo felici di annunciare di aver raggiunto le 55 borse di studio raccolte, per un totale di 165.000€.

vogliamo dare la possibilità a 55 ragazze siciliane di intraprendere una carriera nello sviluppo software frequentando uno dei nostri bootcamp gratuitamente e poter poi lavorare per una delle aziende partner.

non si tratta di soldi raccolti tramite bandi regionali, finanziamenti o altri fondi.

si tratta delle aziende tech più forti in italia che hanno scelto di credere nel nostro progetto e dare alle ragazze più meritevoli la possibilità di essere inserite nel proprio team.

è davvero un privilegio per noi avere dei partner che non smetteremo mai di ringraziare e ai quali dimostreremo ogni giorno la differenza che ci stanno aiutando a fare in sicilia.

today we are happy to announce that we have reached 55 scholarships collected, for a total of €165,000.

We want to give 55 Sicilian girls the opportunity to pursue a career in software development by attending one of our bootcamps for free and then being able to work for one of our partner companies.

it's not about money raised through regional tenders, loans or other funds.

these are the strongest tech companies in Italy who have chosen to believe in our project and give the most deserving girls the opportunity to be included in their team.

It is truly a privilege for us to have partners that we will never stop thanking and to whom we will demonstrate every day the difference they are helping us make in Sicily.

543,"🦄 nonostante il 2022 si stia confermando un anno record per le startup italiane, l'italia è ancora in ritardo nei confronti del resto d'europa.

il terzo trimestre del 2022 è stato il migliore di sempre in termini di finanziamento di venture capital alle startup italiane, questo anche grazie alle recenti operazioni di alcune grandi scaleup come bending spoons o satispay che, con l'ultimo round di finanziamento, hanno raggiunto una valutazione di 1 miliardo di dollari, raggiungendo quindi lo status di ""unicorno"".

ma da questo punto di vista, l'italia è ancora molto indietro: ad ottobre 2022 nel mondo c’erano 1.200 unicorni, 132 di questi erano europei e solo due italiani (satispay e scalapay).

insomma, gli unicorni, esseri introvabili in tutto il mondo sono ancor più rari, inarrivabili e ambiti dalle nostre parti.

ma qualche anno fa, in italia abbiamo avuto una storia di innovazione capace di farci sognare di essere anche noi sul treno del tech e di avere degli unicorni, le startup con una valutazione di oltre 1 miliardo di dollari.

è una storia che parte nel 2007, quando l’imprenditore bolognese marco astorri lancia una startup con un obiettivo molto ambizioso: salvare il mondo dalla plastica, sviluppando un polimero naturale in grado di biodegradarsi in acqua in pochi giorni.
l’azienda si quota in borsa e in appena 4 anni, il suo valore raggiunge 1,3 miliardi di euro di valutazione.

ma poi arriva l'attacco di un fondo di investimenti americano che accusa bio-on di essere un gigantesco bluff. e questo potrebbe essere l'inizio della fine per bio-on.

🎧 ascolta la storia dell'unicorno nel nostro podcast in collaborazione con boats sound su tutte le piattaforme di podcast gratuite.","🦄 despite the fact that 2022 is confirming a record year for Italian startups, Italy is still lagging behind the rest of Europe.

the third quarter of 2022 was the best ever in terms of venture capital financing for Italian startups, this also thanks to the recent operations of some large scaleups such as bending spoons or satispay which, with the latest round of financing, reached a valuation of $1 billion, thereby achieving ""unicorn"" status.

but from this point of view, Italy is still far behind: in October 2022 there were 1,200 unicorns in the world, 132 of these were European and only two Italians (satispay and scalapay).

in short, unicorns, beings that cannot be found all over the world, are even more rare, unattainable and coveted in our area.

but a few years ago, in Italy we had a history of innovation capable of making us dream of being on the tech train too and of having unicorns, startups with a valuation of over 1 billion dollars.

It is a story that began in 2007, when the Bolognese entrepreneur Marco Astorri launched a startup with a very ambitious goal: to save the world from plastic by developing a natural polymer capable of biodegrading in water in just a few days.
the company is listed on the stock exchange and in just 4 years, its value reaches 1.3 billion euros.

but then comes the attack of an American investment fund which accuses bio-on of being a gigantic bluff. and this could be the beginning of the end for bio-on.

562,"da grande utilizzatore di evernote ho seguito con attenzione la vicenda dell'acquisizione da parte di bending spoons avvenuta lo scorso anno, in attesa di novità.

leggo stamattina che pochi giorni fa c'è stato un ulteriore layoff di circa 130 persone. per carità, ne abbiamo visti molti e di molto più corposi negli ultimi trimestri, anche in italia, ma mi vengono sempre dei gran punti di domanda..

dopo gli esodi di molte delle figure chiave di evernote nel 2018, negli ultimi anni tra alti e bassi i numeri erano comunque significativi, anche se non in grado di rimanere al passo con alcuni rivali, uno su tutti notion.

questo articolo di techcrunch prova a ipotizzarne i motivi, escludendo il bisogno di cash da parte di bending spoons, fresca di un round significativo proprio lo scorso anno, mentre tra le motivazioni plausibili la pressione da parte degli investitori o una ricerca più veloce della 'profitability'.

preparandomi per lo scenario peggiore, come si organizza un passaggio da uno strumento all'altro quando lo si usa da anni?

link all'articolo di techcrunch nei commenti.","as a great evernote user, I carefully followed the story of the acquisition by bending spoons which took place last year, waiting for news.

I read this morning that a few days ago there was a further layoff of about 130 people. for heaven's sake, we have seen many and much more substantial ones in recent quarters, also in Italy, but I always get big question marks..

after the exoduses of many of evernote's key figures in 2018, in recent years between ups and downs the numbers were still significant, even if not able to keep up with some rivals, one above all notion.

this techcrunch article tries to hypothesize the reasons, excluding the need for cash on the part of bending spoons, fresh from a significant round just last year, while pressure from investors or a faster search for profitability are among the plausible reasons '.

preparing for the worst case scenario, how do you organize a switch from one tool to another when you've been using it for years?

630,"mi hanno dato 100€ in cambio di soldi finti 😱

non vi preoccupate, non ho truffato nessuno!
è il meccanismo di funzionamento dei giochi free to play, dove gli utenti spendono soldi veri per acquistare valute digitali da usare nel gioco.

quando abbiamo messo il pacchetto da 110€, non speravo minimamente che qualcuno lo comprasse. ho deciso di metterlo solo perché gli altri giochi hanno sempre un pacchetto dal costo estremamente alto. 💸

l'anno scorso durante un periodo di test ho notato che la dashboard riportava qualcosa di insolito: quello che pensavo impossibile era accaduto.
sono rimasto sveglio tutta la notte, immaginandomi presto a dubai a fare foto della mia lambo.

la triste verità è che in media un utente non spendeva più di quanto mi costava acquisirlo (probabilmente complice l'errore di aver fatto il test sul mercato italiano).

👉 ho però imparato una cosa molto interessante.
su 40 acquisti, il 90% proveniva da utenti ios, nonostante le proporzioni di download fossero sbilanciate sugli utenti android. 💡

sarà un caso che bending spoons nei primi anni di vita ha lanciato le sue app solo nel mercato ios?

se ti interessa il mondo mobile,
restiamo in contatto:","they gave me 100€ in exchange for fake money 😱

don't worry, I didn't scam anyone!
it is the working mechanism of free to play games, where users spend real money to buy digital currencies to use in the game.

when we put the 110€ package, I didn't hope that anyone would buy it. I decided to put it only because other games always have an extremely expensive package. 💸

Last year during a test period I noticed the dashboard reporting something unusual: what I thought impossible had happened.
I stayed up all night figuring myself soon in Dubai taking pictures of my Lambo.

the sad truth is that on average a user didn't spend more than what it cost to acquire it (probably due to the mistake of having tested it on the Italian market).

👉 however I learned something very interesting.
out of 40 purchases, 90% came from ios users, despite the proportions of downloads being biased towards android users. 💡

Is it a coincidence that bending spoons launched its apps only on the ios market in its first years of life?

if you are interested in the mobile world,
keep in touch:"
632,"avevo letto tempo fa un articolo in cui si metteva in evidenza il fatto che gli utenti ios fossero più propensi a spendere per app e acquisti in app. la spiegazione era che chi compra un iphone o un ipad è disposto a spendere cifre importanti per un dispositivo, quindi non ha problemi a spendere per una app, mentre chi compra un dispositivo android può spendere molto meno per un modello base ed è meno propenso (o ha meno disponibilità finanziaria) a spendere per le app.
c'è anche l'aspetto ""pirateria"", più semplice su android e abbastanza complicato e rischioso su apple, ma questo è un altro discorso.","I read an article some time ago which highlighted the fact that ios users were more likely to spend on apps and in-app purchases. the explanation was that those who buy an iphone or an ipad are willing to spend significant amounts of money for a device, so they have no problem spending on an app, while those who buy an android device can spend much less for a basic model and are less inclined ( or has less financial resources) to spend on apps.
there is also the ""piracy"" aspect, simpler on android and quite complicated and risky on apple, but that's another matter."

642,"il 31 dicembre 2022 è stata spenta l’app #immuni.

in pochi rimpiangeranno l'app voluta dal #governo per effettuare il tracciamento dei contatti esposti al covid.
l'app non ha infatti mai raggiunto la massa critica di adozione per raggiungere gli obiettivi sperati.

da uomo mi piaceva molto l’idea che la potesse salvare delle vite!

ma se l’idea era buona perche è stato un fallimento?
come si dice per le , l’idea vale zero se non c’è una buona !

nonostante in molti pensino che sia mancata la nell’adottare una soluzione che aveva risvolti di complessi, penso che qui l’anello debole sia stata la strategia di implementazione.
con una penetrazione di internet dell’82% e un mercato dei molto sviluppato, non penso che un’app gratuita, promossa dal ministero della salute per salvare delle vite, avrebbe richiesto un livello di fiducia superiore a quello richiesto dai social.

quindi cosa non ha funzionato?

vale la legge di , che ci ricorda che le app di successo sono quelle che risolvono un percepito dal mercato, di certo non quelle imposte dall’alto.
non sempre il problema è manifesto e l’utente medio potrebbe non riconosce il valore dell’app.
allora si deve procedere con una campagna di per sviluppare , e .

niente e ci si è concentrati sull’individuazione del fornitore tecnologico più bravo.

quante volte mi è capitato di vedere questo in ambito aziendale: pensare che un buon prodotto tecnico avrebbe, da solo, risolto un problema di aziendale!

il successo di immuni non dipendeva tanto dalla qualità del lavoro di , quanto dalla massiccia adozione da parte degli utenti, perché l’adozione di un maggior numero di persone avrebbe generato un beneficio per la collettività superiore alla somma dei benefici individuali dei singoli utenti.

quindi come si poteva procedere?

sappiamo che l’utente medio accetta qualunque trattamento dei dati se può averne utilità: seguire gli amici online, restare aggiornati sui propri interessi (personali o professionali) o intrattenersi con l’ultimo trend del momento.

avendo come obiettivo principale l’adozione massiccia, lo stato avrebbe dovuto offrire delle ricompense agli utenti: un bonus acquisti, accesso facilitato a servizi esclusivi o un cashback sugli acquisti effettuati tramite app (basta vedere il successo nella spinta all’uso delle carte di credito nel 2021).
di certo puntare tutto sull’obbligo per spingerne l’adozione, mal si sposa con logiche di mercato (e in italia anche nelle logiche di cultura civica purtroppo)

a mio avviso l’insuccesso di immuni è dovuto al non essere risusciti a superare con benefici adeguati, il costo che l’utente medio ha ritenuto di sostenere in termini di privacy.

una bella lezione di nella speranza che possa tornare utile per il .","on December 31, 2022 the #immuni app was turned off.

few will regret the app wanted by the #government to trace contacts exposed to the covid.
in fact, the app has never reached the critical mass of adoption to achieve the desired objectives.

as a man I really liked the idea that it could save lives!

but if the idea was good why was it a failure?
as they say for les, the idea is worth zero if there is no good one!

although many think that there was a lack of adopting a solution that had complex implications, I think that the weak link here was the implementation strategy.
with 82% internet penetration and a very developed market for apps, i don't think a free app, promoted by the ministry of health to save lives, would have required a higher level of trust than social media.

so what went wrong?

the law of , which reminds us that successful apps are those that solve a perception by the market, certainly not those imposed from above, is valid.
the problem is not always obvious and the average user may not recognize the value of the app.
then you must proceed with a campaign to develop , and .

nothing and we focused on identifying the best technology supplier.

how many times have I seen this in a business environment: thinking that a good technical product alone would have solved a business problem!

the success of immuni did not depend so much on the quality of the work of , as on the massive adoption by users, because the adoption of a greater number of people would have generated a benefit for the community greater than the sum of the individual benefits of individual users.

so how could it be done?

we know that the average user accepts any data processing if it can be useful: following friends online, staying updated on one's interests (personal or professional) or entertaining oneself with the latest trend of the moment.

having mass adoption as its main objective, the state should have offered rewards to users: a shopping bonus, facilitated access to exclusive services or a cashback on purchases made through the app (just look at the success in the push for the use of credit cards in 2021).
certainly betting everything on the obligation to push its adoption, does not go well with the logic of the market (and in Italy also in the logic of civic culture unfortunately)

in my opinion, the failure of immuni is due to not being able to overcome with adequate benefits, the cost that the average user has deemed to bear in terms of privacy.

a good lesson in the hope that it will be useful for the ."
643,"grazie per questa analisi, mi ha fatto tornare in mente la battuta di un amico al riguardo, di quelle che forse, prese sul serio, diventano soluzioni: l'app andava messa a pagamento, per poi regalarla solo ai vip più invidiati... se conosci il pubblico italiano sai come va a finire 😅","thanks for this analysis, it reminded me of a friend's joke about it, one of those that perhaps, taken seriously, become solutions: the app had to be paid for, and then given away only to the most envied VIPs... if you know the Italian public you know how it ends 😅"

I have not insinuated anything about the management there, but the information you have brought back to me is certainly interesting for a comparison between central and peripheral management of the pandemic."
661,"purtroppo la gestione della pandemia in brasile è stata tropo polarizzata. c’è stata una situazione molto diversa fra le diverse provincie e municipi, dove è stato adottato, per esempio, il trattamento precoce il numero di decessi è stato decisamente basso. in altri posti dove le persone erano ricoverate solo in caso grave con insufficienza respiratoria, il risultato è stato molto negativo.
il presidente bolsonaro non si è vaccinato, ma è garantito a tutti l’accesso ai vaccini e la sua grande preoccupazione era con le persone senza reddito fisso e l’economia in generale, la fame può uccidere di più che la pandemia, tutti i settori dell’agroindustrie e logistiche hanno funzionato in quello periodo. per questo atteggiamento è stato molto criticato. lascia il paese con il minore indice di inflazione, pib in crescita, disoccupazione in decrescita, riduzione generalizzata delle imposte federale.
ma come succede con tutte le pandemie, dopo circa due anni, con vaccini o senza vaccini, la maggioranza della popolazione starà immune. con la app o senza app….","unfortunately the handling of the pandemic in brazil has been too polarised. there was a very different situation between the different provinces and municipalities, where early treatment was adopted, for example, the number of deaths was decidedly low. in other places where people were hospitalized only in severe cases with respiratory failure, the result was very negative.
president bolsonaro did not get vaccinated, but everyone is guaranteed access to vaccines and his big concern was with people without fixed income and the economy in general, hunger can kill more than the pandemic, all sectors of agro-industry and logistics worked in that period. for this attitude he was much criticized. leaves the country with the lowest inflation index, growing pib, decreasing unemployment, generalized reduction of federal taxes.

la domanda viene naturale: cos'è una startup cooperativa?

non è il classico modello di startup e non aspettatevi di trovare dei bending spoons o dei satispay in forma cooperativa. ma sappiamo anche che in italia gli unicorni si contano sulle dita di una mano.

una startup cooperativa è un modello di impresa basato meno sulla crescita esponenziale e più sul valore generato e sul lungo orizzonte. si dice che anche patagonia, prima di donare l'azienda alla no profit, abbia considerato di trasformarsi in cooperativa. perchè la g di governance è l'aspetto più complesso della sostenibilità, e la forma cooperativa si concentra molto su quello.

è vero, non sono famosissime le startup cooperative, ma noi ne conosciamo almeno 60.

se siete curios*, presenteremo il modello in un mix di incontri online e fisici durante il road to coopstartup.

come join us :)","I've been following coopstartup change makers for some time, where we promote the development of cooperative startups.

the question comes naturally: what is a cooperative startup?

it's not the classic startup model and don't expect to find bending spoons or satispays in cooperative form. but we also know that in Italy unicorns can be counted on the fingers of one hand.

a cooperative startup is a business model based less on exponential growth and more on the value generated and the long horizon. Patagonia is also said to have considered turning into a cooperative before donating the company to the non-profit. because the g of governance is the most complex aspect of sustainability, and the cooperative form focuses a lot on that.

it is true, cooperative startups are not very famous, but we know at least 60 of them.

per me fare pausa pranzo alla mensa dell'ufficio significa ancora difficoltà nel controllare quello che mangio (i.e si usano troppi condimenti , spesso grassi) e per qualche motivo quando sono in ufficio ho più fame ed è più facile consumare degli snack. quindi sì, la mia pausa pranzo ha decisamente bisogno di una soluzione!

humamy sembra quasi una soluzione interessante anche per la cena a dire la verità.. scherzando dico sempre che semmai diventassi ricca la prima cosa che farei sarebbe assumere un cuoco che mi prepari tutti i pasti del giorno (saporiti e sani) 😂","super interesting! what were the results of the experiments? :)

for me having a lunch break at the office canteen still means difficulty in controlling what I eat (i.e too many condiments are used, often fatty) and for some reason when I'm in the office I'm hungrier and it's easier to eat snacks. so yeah, my lunch break definitely needs a fix!

humamy almost seems like an interesting solution even for dinner to tell the truth.. jokingly I always say that if I ever become rich the first thing I would do would be to hire a cook to prepare all the meals of the day (tasty and healthy) 😂"

“l’ai è un campo della tecnologia molto ampio e dal potenziale rivoluzionario. parlarne oggi è un po’ come parlare dell’avvento dell’elettricità oltre un secolo fa”, dice ferrari. e se non si troverà il modo di ridistribuire il controllo di questo enorme capitale di conoscenza e tecnologia, se “le cose dovessero andare male”, allora “sarà un futuro poco inclusivo, non egualitario. noi immaginiamo un futuro dove l’ai serve a portare beneficio al maggior numero di persone possibile”.","when he talks about artificial intelligence, luca ferrari doesn't have the wild eyes of the technologist who grew up in the myth of silicon valley, nor the somewhat forced enthusiasm of the founder aware that the destiny of a startup also depends on his public relations.

aprendo l'articolo, mi imbatto in nomi importanti (per citarne alcuni) del calibro di samantha cristoforetti – astronauta , chiara ferragni - , - , - , - , - , - , il mio idolo - e tanti altri nomi noti da cui prendere esempio.

a metà articolo penso: ""chissà se un giorno ci sarò anche io"" poi continuo a leggere e mi accorgo di:
- nicolas lorenzo zeoli – founder
""la loro startup si occupa di economia circolare. hanno realizzato hoooly, un cestino dotato di intelligenza artificiale che riconosce in maniera autonoma i rifiuti occupandosi della corretta raccolta differenziata. hanno vinto il premio “non sprecare” nel 2022.""

mi fermo qualche minuto e sorrido, poi penso: ""boia, ci sono anche io, che ci faccio in mezzo a loro?"". subito dopo ho capito che a maggior ragione dovevamo lavorare ancora di più in questo 2023 per non deludere le aspettative di chi ci ha inserito in una lista così importante per noi.

sono entusiasta e ancor più motivato, nel realizzare i nostri obiettivi, portando a crescere per migliorare l'ambiente in cui viviamo e le abitudini della gestione dei rifiuti.

questo 2022 non lo dimenticheremo mai, come non dimenticheremo mai queste bellissime soddisfazioni che ci danno la spinta per dare il meglio di noi.

tanti auguri di buon anno a tutti!

halfway through the article I think: ""I wonder if one day I'll be there too"" then I continue reading and I realize:

""Their startup deals with the circular economy. They have created hoooly, a bin equipped with artificial intelligence that autonomously recognizes waste and takes care of correct separate collection. They won the ""don't waste"" award in 2022.""

I stop for a few minutes and smile, then I think: ""executioner, I'm here too, what am I doing among them?"". immediately afterwards I realized that all the more reason we had to work even harder in this 2023 so as not to disappoint the expectations of those who have included us in such an important list for us.

I am enthusiastic and even more motivated in achieving our goals, leading to growth to improve the environment in which we live and waste management habits.

🟢 bending spoons , sviluppatrice dell’app immuni, ha acquistato l’app per la raccolta di note e appunti , che vanta più di 250 milioni di utenti attivi.

mai prima d'ora un'azienda americana, made in silicon valley, era stata acquisita da una società italiana.

🌸 ""anche se la proprietà sta cambiando, il nostro impegno a mantenere i dati al sicuro e protetti rimane fermo, l'evernote che conosci continuerà a esserci. l'adesione a bending spoons ci consente di trarre vantaggio dalla loro comprovata esperienza nelle app e l'ampia gamma di tecnologie proprietarie"", ha spiegato sul blog il ceo di evernote, 

ancora sconosciuti i dettagli economici dell'acquisto che diventerà effettivo dal 2023.

🐘 :
fondata nel 2000 dall'imprenditore russo-americano stepan pachikov, con sede nella città californiana di redwood city, produceva in origine un software di riconoscimento della scrittura per windows e l'omonima app evernote per prendere appunti, che archiviava le note scritte dagli utenti su un ""rotolo di carta infinito"". con l'amministratore delegato phil libin, entrato nel 2007, la startup si è focalizzata sul web e sugli smartphone.

tra il 2010 e il 2015 il gruppo ha raccolto centinaia di milioni di dollari in fondi di venture capital da colossi del calibro di sequoia e meritech capital e dalla società di media giapponese nikkei. nel 2013 ha raggiunto la valutazione di quasi 1 miliardo, prima che iniziassero i problemi: in particolare, la scelta di spostarsi dal mondo digitale a quello fisico, con la creazione di accessori da scrivani che però si sono rivelati fallimentari. ","bending elephants!

🟢 bending spoons, developer of the immune app, has purchased the notes and notes collection app, which boasts more than 250 million active users.

never before has an American company, made in silicon valley, been acquired by an Italian company.

🌸 ""While ownership is changing, our commitment to keeping your data safe and secure remains steadfast, the Evernote you know will continue to be there. Joining bending spoons allows us to take advantage of their proven app expertise and the wide range of proprietary technologies,” the evernote CEO explained on the blog,

the economic details of the purchase which will become effective from 2023 are still unknown.

🐘 :
Founded in 2000 by Russian-American entrepreneur Stepan Pachikov, based in the Californian city of Redwood City, it originally produced handwriting recognition software for Windows and the eponymous note-taking app evernote, which archived notes written by users on an ""infinite roll of paper"". with CEO phil libin joining in 2007, the startup focused on the web and smartphones.

between 2010 and 2015, the group raised hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital funds from the likes of sequoia and meritech capital and from japanese media company nikkei. in 2013 it reached a valuation of almost 1 billion, before the problems started: in particular, the decision to move from the digital world to the physical one, with the creation of accessories for scribes which however proved to be unsuccessful."

un paio di esempi: giorni fa aveva fatto notizia una chiesa che per cercare di combattere il calo delle elemosine aveva messo il qr code con il proprio profilo satispay per inviare le offerte con discreto successo. se non basta sappiate che nel mio piccolo comune di 17.000 abitanti, (non proprio milano centro) tutti i piccoli esercizi del centro come i bar, i panifici e le edicole lo hanno spontaneamente adottato come unico strumento di pagamento digitale oltre al pos.

i miei più vivi complimenti ai 3 founder , e e un sentito grazie per dimostrare che anche nel nostro difficile e bel paese si possa sognare in grande!

of course, this isn’t actually what we do, but a metaphor for how we believe that what might seem impossible could actually be possible (thank you, the matrix). and while this is how bending spoons looks at the world, it’s also not far from my life experiences.

there is one time in my life that really felt like a “spoon-bending” moment for me: completing university. after high school, i decided to study mechanical engineering. i was relatively good at math, i liked physics, and it was recommended to me by some teachers. however, i soon realized it wasn’t where i saw my future. i was depressed, my grades were dropping, and at a certain point i didn’t think i’d finish my degree.

in the middle of that, i believed deep down that i was capable of pushing through. i realized i had a choice: to sit still and wallow. or to do something.

through sheer determination, i finished my degree while working part-time at internships and the university. my gpa was solid and i had gained good critical thinking and problem-solving skills. graduating almost felt like a dream, something i never thought i could accomplish. while i realize this might not be a monumental moment for most, for me, i had done something that i had believed was impossible. it was my spoon to bend, and i did.

flash forward to now: i’ve been working at bending spoons for about a year and a half, and i love it. the opportunity to leave a mark and challenge my own conception of what’s possible is incredible. i don’t think i’ve really “bent a spoon” in my job yet. however, with the enormous growth i’ve had in such a short time, i can’t wait to keep driving to make an “impossible” impact here.

906,"when people ask me what i do for a living, and i say i work at a company called bending spoons, there are two types of reactions: “oh yeah, cool!” (~10%) and “eh? bending what?!” (~90%). so i’ve had a few opportunities to try and explain the meaning behind our undeniably odd name. here’s my best version so far: we simply believe that the human mind can often achieve more than what may seem possible (like bending a spoon).

it’s an outlook that served me well when i found myself struggling as a working student. and because i know it’s not an uncommon struggle, i’ll go ahead and walk that fine line between constructive content and pure linkedin cringe and share my story.

in january 2020, i finished my master’s exams and started working full-time with one last little thing to do to complete my studies: the thesis. like everyone, i was psychologically and emotionally exhausted from the lockdowns by the time summer came. but to graduate, i needed to deliver my thesis project by november, and that required every spare second i had. so i cut myself off from the world—again—and started splitting my life between work and the thesis.

it wasn’t long before my willpower began running low. i was feeling so desperate, so far from my goals, that one morning i woke up and just started crying. on that day, i realized that what was unbearable for me, what was making me lose all motivation, was the certainty that this would be my everyday reality for months.

except, it wasn’t a certainty. it didn’t have to be that long. would it be impossible for me to finish my thesis ahead of schedule? improbable, sure. but impossible? maybe not. it was that simple insight that allowed me to completely shift my mindset. i decided to “pretend” that i needed to deliver the thesis by the september session—and i threw myself into making it happen.

i graduated in november. as originally planned. so did i accomplish the impossible? not technically. not this time. but convincing myself that graduating early was possible gave me the energy to get through those tough few weeks and get the bulk of the work done by september—which made the following months feel much less daunting. it also gave me the focus and drive to deliver a thesis that earned me full marks.

so that’s my “spoon-bending-moment” story. and now, let’s see if you found some meaning in it—what does bending spoons mean to you?","when people ask me what i do for a living, and i say i work at a company called bending spoons, there are two types of reactions: “oh yeah, cool!” (~10%) and “eh? bending what?!” (~90%). so i’ve had a few opportunities to try and explain the meaning behind our undeniably odd name. here’s my best version so far: we simply believe that the human mind can often achieve more than what may seem possible (like bending a spoon).

these are all italian tech companies, they're attracting people, capitals and they are all super appealing to youngsters.

10 years ago it was pure science fiction: young people building tech companies and raising an insane amount of money in italy? this must be a joke.

these are all companies that have the power to attract people, reduce the terrible ""fuga di cervelli"" and, thanks to smart/remote working, also repopulate the beautiful italian villages (i can guarantee that it is amazing to work from tuscany or the sicily coast).

this might be the beginning of a needed change, of something new.

1101,"all true but companies are not evil entities that don’t want to pay interns and junior staff; the issue is the good old one: government.

in italy it is as difficult (even more difficult in some instances) to generate the same x revenues of germany, switzerland, uk, but when it comes to spend these revenues in salaries the government takes a bigger portion of that. therefore, we come up with the paradox that the employees are getting less than their international peers, but their employers are spending more for them! not to mention productivity levels, challenges in firing people who failed at their duties etc…

bottom line: higher salaries should be a thing, but unless in italy a company generates more revenues than elsewhere, it would difficult to pay more for the same job. otherwise all these nice rounds of finding will only increase the governments’ pockets. hence, the fuga dei cervelli occur at entrepreneur level as well and there must be a way to stop that other than the stereotypes that interns should be paid more.","all true but companies are not evil entities that don’t want to pay interns and junior staff; the issue is the good old one: government.

✅ horizontal teams (same skills, different goals) are suitable for bootstrapping new competencies in a company, but vertical teams (same goal, different skills) are more effective in achieving business goals.

✅ in creating a successful company it is crucial to have a compelling vision. so is knowing how to take small steps towards your mission while making money. a vision without a profitable business model is just a dream.

✅ many innovative fields are under-regulated: ai, digital medicine, and private space companies. this is dangerous, yet regulators often lack the competencies to create effective frameworks, capable of protecting rights without harming innovation. therefore, transparent cooperation between companies and authorities is necessary.","i was at the sda bocconi, featuring bending spoons, d-orbit, doctolib, and many other great companies. here are my 𝘁𝗼𝗽 𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀.

this was a goal that started more than a year ago. 
 👉 from having no direction last year.
 👉 to finding a path and career i was passionate about.
 👉 to adopting an iterative process of learn-apply-repeat.
 👉 to finally having confidence in my skills.
it involved a lot of failing, and saying no to roles and companies that were not a match, even if it meant staying unemployed for periods during covid.

‘’i’m stuck here forever, because there is no better place to work.’’ this was a review i found about bending spoons. one month in, and i can confidently say that it has been everything what was promised and much, much more. the last month has been spent exclusively on my training, assigning an awesome tutor and teaching me all that they’ve learnt over the years. you know you are in a good place when your growth is the first priority for your teammates and your company. 💪

i found a lot of mentors online in this journey, and i plan on doing a detailed post later, but the ones that stood out, and i recommend to every single person that asks for advice are - 
1. - everything data. start here, please! 🙏
2. - maths and statistics. 📊
3. and - deadly combination for sql. complete their playlist, and i can assure you there will not be a single question you cannot solve. 🐒
4. a certificate is not compulsory, but if you have to choose one, i'd recommend the data analytics professional certificate on .

📲 sometimes it’s hard to balance excellence with supporting people. keeping a that strives for excellence is key to building a great company that sets the example, and by which others can get inspired.

1215,"last week was a memorable one for the italian tech ecosystem 🇮🇹:

 ❇️ raised €320m at a +1bn valuation (2nd 🦄 in italy) in a round led by , with participation from coatue management, , and others.
❇️ , a mobile app developer, raised $340m in debt ($300m) and equity ($40m) from the likes of ryan reynolds and leading italian banks.
❇️ milano and week turin were packed with amazing founders and investors coming from all over europe.

what we learnt last week (data from 2022 thanks ):

 ✴️ 🇮🇹 vc funding is projected to overcome the $2b in 2022 and it just got its 2nd unicorn, but it is still far behind in terms of unicorns compared to 9 🇪🇸 , 31 🇫🇷  , 68 🇩🇪 and 122 🇬🇧
✴️ health & biotech, fintech, enterprise software and food were most vc funded sectors in 2022 in italy
✴️ 🇮🇹 is still not significantly attracting the top european and international vcs

italian founders office hours ongoing journey and commitment 🇮🇹:

⭐ continue with our vc community-building efforts to spur relations and nurture the ecosystem’s texture 🌎
⭐ support italian founders through our 2nd edition of italian founders office hours launching in early 2023
⭐ keep updated our founders resources with up-to-date useful material for founders --

there is still a long way to go but we are very bullish after last week because for the first time many of us saw the potential and ambition of this new generation of investors and founders becoming more collaborative and pushing our ecosystem in the right direction 🚀

1236,"i have a new battle! last week i joined humamy a startup of bending spoons, one of the most innovative companies of italy.

humamy has a big purpose: to feed the world with healthy, delicious and sustainable food.

why does this matter to me? in the last year i’ve had to radically change my eating habits. i used to eat irregularly, carb-intensive and ignored the effect food had on my body. after some medical tests and visiting a nutritionist in spring i realised something wasn’t ok with my body. i had to switch to a balanced, healthier, five-meals-a-day diet.

such a change wasn’t easy. i had to shop for food regularly and dedicate way more time to cooking. i managed partly thanks to job that allowed me to work from home daily and thus allocate the required time. truth be told though, whilst healthier, my dishes were often monotonous and boring!

i can’t but wonder, how many people are in the same position as i used to be in?

in humamy i think we have a solution. we prepare ready-to-eat, 100% plant-based meals, delivered right at your door. they are yummy, nutritious and sustainable.

i’m really excited for this tough but worthy challenge. better food, better people, better planet!","i have a new battle! last week i joined humamy a startup of bending spoons, one of the most innovative companies of italy.

questi 5 giorni saranno un'occasione per far conoscere l’ecosistema innovativo milanese, con visite presso le sedi dei principali players e centri tecnologici (mind, talent garden, fintech district, polihub, bending spoons tra gli altri) e momenti di networking con investitori e altri entri dell'ecosistema che si svolgeranno prevalentemente a palazzo giureconsulti, sede dei nostri uffici.
non mancheranno visite alle principali attrazioni (fondazione prada, castello sforzesco) e aree di sviluppo urbano di milano (bovisa, gae aulenti e porta nuova) per condividere le vibes di una città in evoluzione.
le 20 startup (15 ue - 5 extra ue) partecipanti - alcune delle quali incontrate ad helsinki lo scorso novembre in occasione di slush, tra i principali eventi tech internazionali - operano principalmente nei seguenti ambiti: 50% fintech e 50% life sciences, ict, cleantech."

1420,"at the end of interviews with potential candidates at bending spoons, we always reserve some time for them to ask us questions.
often, the candidates ask a question to understand if the company really is as amazing as it looks from the outside. (spoiler: it is)
a few weeks back a particular candidate asked me to give an example of human connection that particularly stood out in my experience at bending.

i thought about it for a while, and then i told him that one of the things that moved me the most from a personal point of view was the support i received from spooners when i released a song a few months back. my closest teammates were literally listening to it on a loop for days while working. they knew it by heart. and even got it in the top positions of their spotify wrapped 🤯❤️

last week i shared the pre-save campaign for my new song in one of our private channels, and in the matter of an hour i had 30 pre-saves on . i know this may not sound like a lot, but to me it's amazing and it warms my heart. the support from spooners is unlike anything i've seen anywhere else!","at the end of interviews with potential candidates at bending spoons, we always reserve some time for them to ask us questions.

my current personal perspective is: 𝙄 𝙖𝙢 𝙡𝙤𝙫𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙢𝙮 𝙚𝙭𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙖𝙨 𝙖 𝙋𝙝𝘿 𝙨𝙩𝙪𝙙𝙚𝙣𝙩! in the past year, i feel like it helped a lot in refining my critical eye, and in making me realize the importance of being in touch with what i want, feel, and like. of course, despite having learned this through professional work (just because my job gives me great freedom of expressing my interests), it's also helping in almost every other aspect of my life. one funny thing i realized about myself is the notion of taking steps. a step is a session of time when i get into something that brings me somewhere. it could be 10 minutes of sifting through emails, leading me to a place where that cursed number of todo's is smaller. it could be an afternoon spent in updating and reorganizing my photo library, leading me to being more conscious of the quality of time i've been experiencing lately. or, it could be a whole night spent in debugging a code, and reading and bookmarking answers on stack overflow, until i get to ""the piece of code works and, geez, i've just remembered once again how i keep underestimating the amount of time that debugging actually needs"". the realization is: i kind of need to take at least 𝙤𝙣𝙚 𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙥 𝙚𝙖𝙘𝙝 𝙙𝙖𝙮.

on a technical note, last week i attended bending spoons' synapse symposium, where researchers from both academia and big firms (mit, epfl, google, facebook) gave talks on the most recent trends in computer vision and natural language processing. things are moving so fast it's getting harder and harder to feel genuinely amazed by new ai technologies; but i was particularly amazed by 𝙇𝙖𝙧𝙜𝙚 𝙇𝙖𝙣𝙜𝙪𝙖𝙜𝙚 𝙈𝙤𝙙𝙚𝙡𝙨 and 𝙨𝙤𝙘𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮-𝙖𝙬𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙫𝙚𝙝𝙞𝙘𝙪𝙡𝙖𝙧 𝙖𝙪𝙩𝙤𝙢𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. i'll also say that, as someone who studies (and, you know, roots for) interpretable ai, i've had a hard time looking for signs of an (adequate) general interest in topics of ai interpretability and transparency. i'll process this finding throughout august. :)

final segment: for those who made it here, i'd like to announce that tomorrow 𝙄 𝙬𝙞𝙡𝙡 𝙩𝙖𝙠𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩 𝙞𝙣 𝙅𝙪𝙡𝙞𝙖𝘾𝙤𝙣, the official conference organized by the julia community, with a 10-minute talk on . julia is currently the most elegant general-purpose language i know (second place right after haskell, in which i'm not so fluent anymore), so i'm just super thrilled! still, i promise i won't post too much about it, but let me mention something peculiar: my talk was accepted because symbolic learning is, as the reviewers put it, ""kind of underrepresented"".

indeed, let's keep it going! :d","it's helpful every now and then to put things into perspective, and i believe summer is the right time to do that.

on a technical note, last week i attended bending spoons' synapse symposium, where researchers from both academia and big firms (mit, epfl, google, facebook) gave talks on the most recent trends in computer vision and natural language processing. things are moving so fast it's getting harder and harder to feel genuinely amazed by new ai technologies; but i was particularly amazed by 𝙇𝙖𝙧𝙜𝙚 𝙇𝙖𝙣𝙜𝙪𝙖𝙜𝙚 𝙈𝙤𝙙𝙚𝙡𝙨 and 𝙨𝙤𝙘𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮-𝙖𝙬𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙫𝙚𝙝𝙞𝙘𝙪𝙡𝙖𝙧 𝙖𝙪𝙩𝙤𝙢𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. i'll also say that, as someone who studies (and, you know, roots for) interpretable ai, i've had a hard time looking for signs of an (adequate) general interest in topics of ai interpretability and transparency. i'll process this finding throughout august. :)

final segment: for those who made it here, i'd like to announce that tomorrow 𝙄 𝙬𝙞𝙡𝙡 𝙩𝙖𝙠𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩 𝙞𝙣 𝙅𝙪𝙡𝙞𝙖𝘾𝙤𝙣, the official conference organized by the julia community, with a 10-minute talk on . julia is currently the most elegant general-purpose language i know (second place right after haskell, in which i'm not so fluent anymore), so i'm just super thrilled! still, i promise i won't post too much about it, but let me mention something peculiar: my talk was accepted because symbolic learning is, as the reviewers put it, ""kind of underrepresented"".

indeed, let's keep it going! :d"

1563,"how do you connect two tech ecosystems, and why? ⁉



i had the pleasure to develop and pilot a new concept event under the umbrella: ""nordics meet"". the stated goal is to develop new ties with an ecosystem that is not ""known"", to walk on a unbeaten path: italy was our first destination.

why? timing and relevance 🌟 .

- italy has been breaking its investment records (2.1b€ in 2022 from 1.3b € in 2021), with international investments supporting this growth, 💰
- generated new unicorns and more coming (, , ); 🦄
- eu funding member and third biggest market of the eu (59m people living);
- more international players are expanding their presence (, and more);
- huge demand for digital products and solutions - need to revitalize the economy post-covid;
- moving now = being ahead of the curve = opportunity for pioneers! 💥

hence some good reasons to try and place our (nordic and baltic ❄ ) region as a first mover: we can carve a primary role in the definition of the new startup ecosystem, provide our unicorns, scaleups and startups access to a big market + skilled people. a bit unusual tactic, as the nordic strategy overall seems to be mainly focused on to ""attract"" to our region. while i believe in ""pushing"" instead of ""pulling"", especially when there is so much good to share 🤝 .

the (old) nordics tend to act like a bubble 💭 - its main expansion direction being the us and uk market. yet, within the eu there is a collection of 27 markets, where the nordics and baltics are one of its most performing macro-regions. to tap into the eu market grants the nordics with:

- stronger and more resilient companies; 💪
- access to diverse talent pools; 👩‍💼
- more visibility and create traction to the northern region; 🔝
- import (to the nordics) a more ""pan-european wide"" perspective, expertise and insights, while exporting ""the nordic way"". 🛫

a big thank you for the participants that made ""nordics meet italia"" a unique learning experience! once again, thank you to  (with the collaboration of  and ), , , and .

excited about this outcome, i will keep on working on bringing more of the baltics and nordics to the world! 🥚

1602,"«la mia azienda? la migliore di tutte»

«il mio obiettivo di lungo termine è sempre stato quello di costruire una grande azienda, ammirata da tutti, che rendesse il mondo un posto migliore. una delle migliori imprese di tutti i tempi».

se queste vi sembrano le parole di un pazzo visionario, vi sbagliate di grosso. , 37 anni, ceo e cofondatore insieme a , , e di , questa azienda l’ha creata davvero.

500 dipendenti, 158 milioni di dollari di fatturato nel 2022, bending spoons non è solo tra i principali sviluppatori di app al mondo (dove ai primi posti siedono google e meta), con 100 milioni di utenti e 500 milioni di download. è anche ai primi posti nelle classifiche dei “best workplaces”, i migliori posti dove lavorare in italia e in europa.

risultati non arrivati per caso, ma frutto di duro lavoro. «non conosco nessun imprenditore con l’ambizione di fare qualcosa di rilevante a livello mondiale che non abbia attraversato un percorso difficile e faticoso, pieno di paure e ansie».

a novembre 2022 bending spoons ha acquisito evernote, l’azienda della silicon valley che ha creato la famosa applicazione per la gestione di impegni e appunti.

la sua bellissima storia è raccontata su millionaire di aprile, in edicola e su digitale.
l’avete letta? che ne pensate?","""My company? the best of all”

«My long-term goal has always been to build a great company, admired by all, that makes the world a better place. one of the best feats of all time.""

if these seem like the words of a crazy visionary to you, you are very wrong. , 37, CEO and co-founder together with , , and of , really created this company.

500 employees, 158 million dollars in turnover in 2022, bending spoons is not only among the leading app developers in the world (where google and meta sit at the top), with 100 million users and 500 million downloads. it is also at the top of the “best workplaces” rankings, the best places to work in Italy and Europe.

results not arrived by chance, but the result of hard work. «I don't know any entrepreneur with the ambition to do something globally relevant who hasn't gone through a difficult and tiring path, full of fears and anxieties».

in November 2022 bending spoons acquired evernote, the silicon valley company that created the famous application for managing tasks and notes.

his beautiful story is told in millionaire di aprile, on newsstands and digitally.

1605,"電腦玩物：「evernote 即將在 5 月推出價格、功能上的一系列調整，身為多年 evernote 使用者，也幫大家整理一下。

價格的部分，以台灣來說，「個人版」價格將會提升到月費 170元（新台幣）、年費1530元。「專業版」價格將會提升到月費 210元、年費2090元。新定價將自 5 月 1 日起生效。而對舊用戶來說，新定價將於下一次續訂日生效。我們也會在續訂日的 28 天前主動通知所有將受到影響的客戶。

我自己目前是使用「專業版」，剛剛看價格是年費 1890 元，所以年費確實有調漲了200元左右。但從我個人的角度來說，在可以接受的範圍內。

價格調漲的同時， evernote 以及新的母公司 bending spoons 也承諾了即將在 5 月推出的一系列功能更新，其中最重要的有：

- 同步效能改進
- 多人即時編輯
- ai 筆記整理
- ai 筆記搜尋（可以把自己的所有筆記資料庫，變成自己專屬的 ai 問答工具，這一點我最期待，畢竟我有 15000 多則筆記可以問答！）


下面是功能細節：

- 同步效能改進
- 調整 evernote 同步結構方式，預計 5 月 1 日前顯著降低記事衝突發生頻率。（目前我自己電腦端的運用是很順暢的，但手機 app 似乎還需要更新）
- 預計到 5 月 5 日，所有 evernote 用戶都將看到同一筆記衝突的頻率顯著降低（在大多數情況下，完全消除）。
- 未來將加速新記事跨裝置同步，可以在不同裝置即時同步編輯

- 多人即時編輯
- 5 月 5 日推出
- 基於同步改進，實現無縫多設備同步編輯
- 適用於多設備用戶和團隊協作
- 採用 crdt 和 yjs 技術，解決筆記衝突問題

- ai 筆記整理
- ai 功能將僅限於選擇加入，這意味著除非您明確指示 evernote 這樣做，否則您的數據將不會被 ai 模型處理。
- ai 筆記整理，將從 5 月開始推出。看示範是把雜亂筆記，整理成有條理的大綱或表格筆記。
- 麗如在重要會議中瘋狂地做筆記，然後在會議結束後花很長時間整理它們？ai 筆記整理為您完成了無聊且耗時的部分。
- 在功能僅供訂閱用戶使用之前，每個用戶都可以免費使用一個月。

- ai 搜索
- 您可以直接通過文本向您的 evernote 應用程序提出自然語言問題，並根據您筆記的內容立即獲得答案。
- 會規畫著重用戶隱私保護的機制，預計下半年推出


我自己雖然這幾年也努力介紹許多不同的筆記工具，例如 notion、 obsidian、 logseq、 heptabase 等等，但是我個人依然還是使用 evernote 作為個人知識庫的主力筆記工具，所以我是很期待這些更新，也能接受這個價格調整的。

之後如果新功能推出，我再跟大家一一介紹。」","Computer toys: ""evernote will launch a series of price and function adjustments in May. As an evernote user for many years, I will help you sort it out.

As for the price, in Taiwan, the price of the ""Personal Edition"" will be raised to 170 yuan (TWD) per month and 1,530 yuan per year. The price of ""Professional Edition"" will be increased to 210 yuan per month and 2090 yuan per year. The new pricing will be effective on May 1. For existing users, the new pricing will take effect on the next renewal date. We are also proactively notifying all affected customers 28 days prior to the renewal date.

I am currently using the ""Professional Edition"". I just saw that the annual fee is 1890 yuan, so the annual fee has indeed increased by about 200 yuan. But from my personal point of view, within an acceptable range.

At the same time as the price increase, Evernote and its new parent company, bending spoons, also promised a series of feature updates that will be launched in May, the most important of which are:

- Sync performance improvements
- Multiplayer instant editing
- ai note organization
- ai note search (you can turn all your note databases into your own exclusive ai question answering tool, which I am most looking forward to, after all, I have more than 15,000 notes for question and answer!)


Here are the functional details:

- Sync performance improvements
- Adjust the evernote synchronization structure, and it is expected that the frequency of note conflicts will be significantly reduced before May 1st. (Currently, the use of my own computer is very smooth, but the mobile app seems to need to be updated)
- It is expected that by May 5th, all evernote users will see a significant reduction (in most cases, complete elimination) of same-note conflicts.
- In the future, cross-device synchronization of new notes will be accelerated, allowing real-time synchronous editing on different devices

- Multiplayer instant editing
- Available May 5th
- Based on synchronization improvement, realize seamless multi-device simultaneous editing
- Suitable for multi-device users and team collaboration
- Use crdt and yjs technology to solve note conflicts

- ai note organization
- ai functionality will be opt-in only, meaning your data will not be processed by the ai model unless you explicitly instruct evernote to do so.
- ai Note Organizer, which will be launched in May. Watching the demonstration is to organize messy notes into organized outline or table notes.
- Liru frantically taking notes during an important meeting and then spending a long time organizing them after the meeting? ai Note Organizer does the boring and time-consuming part for you.
- Each user can use it for free for one month before the feature becomes available only to subscribers.

- ai search
- You can ask natural language questions to your evernote app directly via text and get instant answers based on the content of your notes.
- A mechanism focusing on user privacy protection will be planned, which is expected to be launched in the second half of the year


Although I have tried to introduce many different note-taking tools in the past few years, such as notion, obsidian, logseq, heptabase, etc., I still use evernote as the main note-taking tool for my personal knowledge base, so I am looking forward to these updates. This price adjustment is also acceptable.

If new features are released later, I will introduce them to you one by one. """

1619,"coding women sicily non è nata per caso, ma per sfida.

ogni azione e ogni scelta presa negli ultimi anni in edgemony ha avuto uno specifico focus, la sicilia, e un obiettivo, anzi due: creare opportunità di lavoro e valorizzare i talenti.

si sente spesso parlare di disoccupazione femminile, opportunità lavorative mancanti e gender gap. sembra diventata quasi una moda parlarne.

ma come si fa concretamente qualcosa?

coding women sicily è nata per le donne, ma, anche e soprattutto, grazie alle donne che hanno frequentato il nostro primo coding bootcamp. dai loro sogni, dalla loro forza, ma anche dalle loro insicurezze.

oggi siamo felici, le richieste che ci arrivano quotidianamente sono sorprendenti ed è un segnale forte: siamo sulla strada giusta!

abbiamo raccolto 165mila euro in borse di studio (fino ad ora) grazie a coding women sicily e questi numeri non li avremmo mai potuti raggiungere se non fosse stato per le aziende sponsor che ci supportano ogni giorno.
è difficile spiegare in che modo lo fanno. non è solo un’adesione al progetto, ma prendono aerei, pernottano in sicilia, vivono giorni intensi di duro lavoro tra colloqui e meeting. vogliono conoscerle, ma soprattutto vogliono spronarle. credono in loro e lo dimostra il tasso di assunzione superiore al 85%.

tutto questo crediamo sia impagabile ed è quello che ci spinge a fare sempre di più.

grazie a chi ci sta già sostenendo e a chi ci sosterrà!

 tui           

per applicare per una delle borse disponibili o contribuire come azienda trovi il link nei commenti 👇","coding women sicily was not born by chance, but by challenge.

every action and every choice taken in recent years in edgemony has had a specific focus, Sicily, and a goal, or rather two: to create job opportunities and enhance talent.

we often hear about female unemployment, missing job opportunities and the gender gap. it seems to have become almost a fashion to talk about it.

but how do you actually do something?

coding women sicily was born for women, but, also and above all, thanks to the women who attended our first coding bootcamp. from their dreams, from their strength, but also from their insecurities.

today we are happy, the requests we receive every day are surprising and it is a strong signal: we are on the right track!

we have raised 165 thousand euros in scholarships (until now) thanks to coding women sicily and we would never have been able to reach these numbers if it hadn't been for the sponsor companies that support us every day.
it is difficult to explain how they do this. it's not just an adhesion to the project, but they take planes, stay overnight in Sicily, live intense days of hard work between interviews and meetings. they want to know them, but above all they want to encourage them. they believe in them and the hiring rate of over 85% proves it.

we believe all of this is priceless and it is what drives us to do more and more.

thanks to those who are already supporting us and to those who will support us!

mám na ně samozřejmě za trapné synchronizační bugy trochu pifku, takže jsem čekal s čím příjde nový majitel, bending spoons.

v prvé řadě hned nástroj zdražili. o polovinu.

ok hodnotu to může mít i tak, co dál? jaké fíčury nabídnou?

a musím říct, že to nevypadá zle:

— v květnu prý vyřeší drtivou většinu synchronizačních problémů, zavádějí (kdyžtak googlete nebo viz článek).

— zapojení ai muselo přijít, ale působí to na mě rozumně, nikoliv zbrkle jako u notion a jiných: vyhledávání přirozeným jazykem a dále pročištění rychlých poznámek ze schůzky do čitelné podoby.

tak jo. ještě jim dám pár měsíců šanci.","I know I'm probably the last one using evernote here... 😅

Of course, I have a bit of a crush on them for the embarrassing synchronization bugs, so I was waiting to see what the new owner, bending spoons, would come up with.

first of all, they immediately made the instrument more expensive. by half.

ok it can still have value, what next? what features will they offer?

and I must say it doesn't look bad:

— in May they say they will solve the vast majority of synchronization problems, they introduce (if you google it or see the article).

— the inclusion of ai had to come, but it seems reasonable to me, not hasty as with notion and others: natural language search and further cleaning of quick notes from the meeting into a readable form.

so yeah. I'll give them a chance for a few more months."

grazie a lei, per l'invito e per aver voluto che portassi attenzione al tema a me caro dell'individuo, come risorsa in grado di manifestare il suo potenziale e creare valore, se motivato e capace di tenere nei momenti di criticità. il passaggio dalla start-up all'azienda più stabile richiede certamente di saper gestire il delicato passaggio delle competenze (hard skills) dall'essere generalisti verso la specializzazione. tuttavia oggi non basta e dopo tre anni di pressioni psicologiche e sociali tra pandemia, senso di prossimità alla guerra, crisi energetica e inflazione, è necessario che l'azienda si veda finalmente come quel nucleo sociale più prossimo all'individuo e alla famiglia, e che per un concreto perseguimento di quel di cui spesso si parla, consideri come fondamentale un welfare aziendale più coerente alle famiglie e il rinforzo delle life e soft skills che sostengono tenacia e resilienza, affinchè ciascuno (nel suo essere risorsa umana!) mantenga capacità di pensiero critico, visione positiva, capacità di ascolto, di trovare soluzioni utili a diversi punti di vista in una logica win-win, che non è compromesso, ma la ricerca davvero di soluzioni soddisfacenti per le diverse parti.

preziosa l'occasione di dialogo e confronto anche personale. grazie agli interventi di diego rossetti, , e in particolare delle esperienze condivise da  co-fondatrice di hacking talents,  co-fondatrice di mirta, carlo pulcini, data analytics lead di bending spoons.

     ","checkmate? scale up!
#scalability was the theme of the annual meeting of young entrepreneurs organized by Confindustria Alto Milanese in the splendid setting of Villa Ida Lampugnani in Parabiago. interesting how in a marvelous and historic place, which took us out of time for a few hours, over 70 young people confronted themselves with innovative and successful issues, between reflections on the institutional framework and the criticality of the in an era in which it is difficult to keep and, indeed, in which the recently declared that it is the prevailing feeling today in Italians, alongside no longer being available to make sacrifices for any reason.
it was therefore courageous to address the issue of start-ups and new development ideas, when - to quote the words of , today's president from Milan - 'every move can have very positive effects or be a disaster'.
thanks to her, for the invitation and for having wanted me to bring attention to the subject dear to me of the individual, as a resource capable of manifesting his potential and creating value, if motivated and capable of holding up in critical moments. the transition from the start-up to the more stable company certainly requires knowing how to manage the delicate transition of skills (hard skills) from being generalists towards specialization. however today it is not enough and after three years of psychological and social pressures between the pandemic, a sense of proximity to war, the energy crisis and inflation, it is necessary for the company to finally see itself as that social nucleus closest to the individual and the family, and that for a concrete pursuit of what is often talked about, considers a more coherent corporate welfare for families as fundamental and the reinforcement of life and soft skills that support tenacity and resilience, so that everyone (in his being a human resource!) maintains the ability to critical thinking, positive vision, listening skills, to find useful solutions to different points of view in a win-win logic, which is not compromise, but the search for truly satisfactory solutions for the different parties.

the opportunity for dialogue and even personal confrontation is precious. thanks to the interventions of diego rossetti, , and in particular of the experiences shared by co-founder of hacking talents, co-founder of mirta, carlo Pulcini, data analytics lead of bending spoons.

1717,"porta nuova a milano riceve oggi la prima doppia certificazione di sostenibilità al mondo a livello di quartiere. il distretto è infatti il primo a ottenere le certificazioni leed® e well® for community, che misurano la sostenibilità sociale, ambientale ed economica di una rigenerazione a scala urbana. il riconoscimento internazionale, assegnato dall’ e dall', contribuisce a posizionare il paese tra i territori più avanzati nel perseguire investimenti immobiliari sostenibili con un impatto misurabile e trasparente. le due certificazioni documentano il coinvolgimento della comunità nell’attivazione degli spazi pubblici e nella creazione di un modello economico urbano innovativo e replicabile. in particolare, la certificazione leed® for cities and communities analizza la qualità della vita nei centri urbani, valutando la sostenibilità di materiali e tecniche costruttive impiegati, l’impatto ambientale degli edifici e l’utilizzo di fonti energetiche rinnovabili; il riconoscimento well® community standard considera l’integrazione delle persone attraverso gli spazi pubblici, ponendo come priorità la protezione della salute e del benessere fisico e mentale in tutti gli aspetti della vita di comunità. un traguardo chiave per milano e per l’italia, che può dire oggi di ospitare il primo quartiere sostenibile al mondo.
per approfondimenti si rimanda al comunicato stampa sul nostro sito web","porta nuova in milan today receives the first double sustainability certification in the world at neighborhood level. the district is in fact the first to obtain the leed® and well® for community certifications, which measure the social, environmental and economic sustainability of regeneration on an urban scale. the international recognition, awarded by and by, helps to position the country among the most advanced territories in pursuing sustainable real estate investments with a measurable and transparent impact. the two certifications document the involvement of the community in the activation of public spaces and in the creation of an innovative and replicable urban economic model. in particular, the leed® certification for cities and communities analyzes the quality of life in urban centres, assessing the sustainability of the materials and construction techniques used, the environmental impact of buildings and the use of renewable energy sources; the well® community standard recognition considers the integration of people through public spaces, placing as a priority the protection of health and physical and mental well-being in all aspects of community life. a key milestone for milan and for italy, which can now claim to host the first sustainable district in the world.

1780,"il terzo trimestre del 2022 è stato il migliore di sempre in termini di finanziamento di venture capital alle startup italiane. insomma, l'italia, non è (ancora) un paese per startup, ma qualcosa si sta muovendo.

secondo i dati di , presentati qualche giorno fa all'week di torino, in italia gli investimenti in startup continuano a crescere.

se nel 2021 per la prima volta è stato superato il muro del miliardo di dollari investiti dai fondi di investimento specializzati nelle startup nel nostro paese, quest'anno potremmo addirittura sfondare i 2 miliardi di dollari, con una crescita prevista del 64%.

questo è un dato particolarmente significativo se confrontato con quello europeo, dove gli investimenti sembrano essere destinati a diminuire del 9%, il primo declino dopo almeno 6 anni consecutivi di crescita.

negli ultimi 3 mesi hanno certamente influito le recenti operazioni di alcune grandi scaleup come bending spoons o satispay che, con l'ultimo round di finanziamento, ha raggiunto una valutazione di 1 miliardo di dollari, raggiungendo quindi lo status di ""unicorno"".

nonostante questo, il ritardo accumulato con il resto d'europa è ancora grande: se confrontiamo gli investimenti pro capite, l’italia si trova solo al 29esimo posto, con un investimento medio di 18 euro per abitante, una posizione molto peggiore rispetto a quella di altri paesi europei.

per recuperare il divario, sia in termini di crescita che di finanziamenti, c’è quindi ancora molto da fare qui in italia. la nascita di nuovi attori come incubatori, acceleratori e startup builder come , che aiutano le aziende nelle prime fasi di vita, e l’introduzione di nuovi strumenti come il fondo cdp venture capital, fanno ben sperare per il futuro dell’innovazione in italia. ma continuano ad essere necessari ulteriori passi avanti in termini di meno burocrazia per attrarre più investimenti e anche nuovi talenti dall’estero.

proprio in questi giorni sta chiudendo le selezioni per i 40 partecipanti alla nuova edizione del suo programma di startup building. le candidature sono aperte fino a venerdì 14 ottobre ➡️","the third quarter of 2022 was the best ever in terms of venture capital financing to Italian startups. In short, Italy is not (yet) a country for startups, but something is moving.

according to data from , presented a few days ago at the turin week, investments in startups continue to grow in italy.

if in 2021 the billion dollar wall invested by investment funds specialized in startups in our country was exceeded for the first time, this year we could even break through the 2 billion dollars, with an expected growth of 64%.

this is a particularly significant data if compared with the European one, where investments seem to be destined to decrease by 9%, the first decline after at least 6 consecutive years of growth.

in the last 3 months the recent operations of some large scaleups such as bending spoons or satispay have certainly influenced which, with the latest round of financing, has reached a valuation of 1 billion dollars, thus reaching the status of ""unicorn"".

despite this, the gap accumulated with the rest of Europe is still great: if we compare per capita investments, Italy is only in 29th place, with an average investment of 18 euros per inhabitant, a much worse position than that from other European countries.

to close the gap, both in terms of growth and funding, there is therefore still a lot to do here in Italy. the birth of new players such as incubators, accelerators and startup builders such as , which help companies in the early stages of life, and the introduction of new tools such as the cdp venture capital fund, bode well for the future of innovation in italy. but further steps forward in terms of less bureaucracy continue to be needed to attract more investment and also new talent from abroad.

just in these days it is closing the selections for the 40 participants in the new edition of its startup building program. applications are open until Friday 14 October ➡️"

une fois n'est pas coutume, une startup californienne tres connue se fait racheter par une societe italienne...

il n'est pas commun de voir une startup californienne etre acquise par une entreprise europeennne, encore moins italienne. no offense.

et pourtant, la nouvelle est tombee hier soir, pacific time.
, un des pionniers des applications de prise de note, fera partie de , basee a milan, dans quelques semaines.

evernote, comme je l'ai deja indique, c'est mon application preferentielle lorsqu'il s'agit de creer du contenu textuel.
c""est par exemple sur evernote, que je suis en train de rediger ce post.

mais evernote, c'est aussi une societe en difficulte depuis des annees.
des difficultes face a l'essort de et a sa capacite d'innovation en continu.
il semble donc que le choix du rapprochement ait ete celui de la survie de l'entreprise.

vous ne connaissiez pas bending spoons ? j'avoue que moi non plus.
pour commencer, bending spoons, c'est une entreprise qui a recemment leve 340 millions de dollars (octobre 2022).

et surtout, c'est une galaxie d'applications mobiles a succes :
. , un editeur video,
. remini, un editeur photo, avec de l'ai,
. 30 day fitness, une app de... fitness,
. fonts, une app qui remplace votre clavier mobile.

combinees, ces applications mobiles drainent 100 millions d'utilisateurs.

, ceo de bending spoons, indique que le rachat permettra de faire profiter a evernote de ses technologies proprietaires.
on peut donc imaginer de grandes ameliorations en termes d'experience et de fonctionalites.
en tout cas, j'y crois. et je resterai fidele a evernote d'ici la.

que pensez-vous de cette information ?","⚡ thunderbolt in the tech world. ⚡
once is not custom, a well-known Californian startup is bought by an Italian company...

it is not common to see a Californian startup being acquired by a European company, let alone an Italian one. no offence.

and yet, the news fell last night, pacific time.
, one of the pioneers of note-taking apps, will be part of milan-based , in a few weeks.

Evernote, as I mentioned before, is my go-to app when it comes to creating textual content.
it is for example on evernote, that I am writing this post.

but evernote has also been a struggling company for years.
difficulties in the face of the development of and its capacity for continuous innovation.
it therefore seems that the choice of merger was that of the company's survival.

you didn't know bending spoons? I admit that neither do I.
for starters, bending spoons is a company that recently raised $340 million (October 2022).

and above all, it is a galaxy of successful mobile applications:
. , a video editor,
. remini, a photo editor, with ai,
. 30 day fitness, a fitness app,
. fonts, an app that replaces your mobile keyboard.

Combined, these mobile applications attract 100 million users.

, ceo of bending spoons, says the takeover will allow evernote to benefit from its proprietary technologies.
we can therefore imagine great improvements in terms of experience and functionality.
in any case, I believe in it. and I'll stick with evernote until then.

1900,"personne n'en a parlé mais...

rip evernote... 😢

concrètement, la célèbre application de prise de note est toujours live, mais ils viennent d'accepter une offre de la société bending spoons.

cette dernière est spécialisée dans la création d'applications grand public avec une (très) belle base utilisateurs.

🧐 mais est-ce que cela changera la situation d'evernote ? j'en doute fort.

il y a fort à parier que l'application sera là encore de nombreuses années, mais ce rachat est la preuve qu'il n'y a plus de capitaine et de stratégie pour evernote.

et cela s'explique notamment par la montée d'une application comme qui a rebattu les cartes et qui devient aujourd'hui incontournable pour gérer et structurer sa société.

petite pensée émue pour une application qui m'a accompagné au début de ma carrière, mais qui n'a pas su véritablement innover pour rester dans le jeu.

maintenant, je suis un ""notion guy"" ! 🤩

des moments comme celui-ci permettent de rappeler une chose : malgré toutes vos levées de fonds qui vous permettent d'être forts à un moment, vous pouvez tomber rapidement !

et ça sera aussi valable... pour notion !

hâte de voir la suite !","nobody talked about it but...

rip evernote... 😢

concretely, the famous note-taking application is still live, but they have just accepted an offer from the company bending spoons.

the latter specializes in the creation of consumer applications with a (very) good user base.

🧐 but will this change evernote's situation? I highly doubt it.

it's a safe bet that the application will be there for many more years, but this takeover is proof that there is no longer a captain and a strategy for evernote.

and this is explained in particular by the rise of an application like which has reshuffled the cards and which is now becoming essential for managing and structuring your company.

little emotional thought for an application that accompanied me at the start of my career, but which did not really know how to innovate to stay in the game.

Now I'm a ""notion guy""! 🤩

Moments like this are a reminder of one thing: despite all your fundraising that allows you to be strong at one time, you can fall quickly!

and it will also be valid... for notion!

Wait to see more !"

je dis ça avec beaucoup d'amertume car c'est l'un des outils qui a changé ma vie (je suis rentré dans le no-code grâce à lui). c'est un gâchis immense, surtout parce qu'ils avaient toutes les cartes en main quand les autres concurrents n'existaient même pas.

I just think their product team did a shitty job and complicated the app unnecessarily over the years, so much so that in the end it was wasting our time more than anything else. ..

I say that with a lot of bitterness because it's one of the tools that changed my life (I got into no-code thanks to it). it's a huge mess, especially because they had all the cards when the other competitors didn't even exist.

1. constant attention to security and data protection. bending spoons is a European company, is part of their vocabulary and is at the heart of their developments

2. listening to users and experts, with supporting data. while respecting point 1, bending spoons relies heavily on data to improve its products, as well as user feedback

1936,"chi mi conosce sa che le #startup sono una delle mie più grandi passioni, ed una delle considerazioni più comunemente accettata tra gli appassionati è quanto questo modello di impresa sia difficile, macchinoso, ed a volte anche poco ""appealing"" da portare avanti in italia: indubbiamente poli come berlino, londra, tel aviv, barcellona ed altri vengono in mente prima di milano, roma e tutte le altre nostre città del bel paese.

ciò non scoraggia però moltissimi imprenditori a credere ed investire nel nostro paese, e trovo che sia esaltante e motivante vedere storie di successo: solo nell'ultima settimana, abbiamo tre esempi eclatanti tutti italiani, e tutto ciò mi gasa tantissimo!

- chiude un round d di 320 milioni di €, portando la sua valutazione oltre il miliardo e diventando qualcosa di elusivo per il nostro panorama, ossia un unicorno italiano

- raccoglie 340 milioni di $ da investitori internazionali di spessore come (ex. ceo di ) ed anche l'attore (il quale ha annunciato che hugh jackman tornerà ad interpretare wolverine in deadpool 3, ma questa è un'altra storia 😃)

- , fresca di un rebranding super intrigante giusto due settimane fa, annunciava ieri di entrare di prepotenza nel mercato francese comprando la proptech francese nonchè sua competitor , la visione del ceo di diventare leader in europa si sta davvero realizzando.

sono davvero curioso di vedere come continueranno e che altri esempi di successo salteranno fuori in futuro 🚀 🇮🇹","anyone who knows me knows that #startups are one of my greatest passions, and one of the most commonly accepted considerations among enthusiasts is how difficult, cumbersome, and sometimes even not very ""appealing"" this business model is to carry on in Italy : undoubtedly poles like berlin, london, tel aviv, barcelona and others come to mind before milan, rome and all our other cities in the beautiful country.

however, this does not discourage many entrepreneurs from believing and investing in our country, and I find it exhilarating and motivating to see success stories: in the last week alone, we have three striking examples, all Italian, and all of this excites me so much!

- closes a round d of €320 million, bringing its valuation over one billion and becoming something elusive for our panorama, i.e. an Italian unicorn

- raises $340 million from international investors such as (ex. ceo of ) and also the actor (who announced that hugh jackman will return to play wolverine in deadpool 3, but that's another story 😃)

- , fresh from a super intriguing rebranding just two weeks ago, announced yesterday that it would forcefully enter the French market by buying the French proptech as well as its competitor , the CEO's vision of becoming a leader in Europe is really coming true.

I'm really curious to see how they will continue and that other successful examples will emerge in the future 🚀 🇮🇹"

1944,"pourquoi vous ne devriez pas utiliser chatgpt, lensa, dawn ai, etc. 👇

j'observe un réel engouement depuis plusieurs semaines pour les différentes applications d'ia rendues publiques, que ce soit au niveau image (avec par exemple lensa, dawn ai, midjourney etc.) ou au niveau langage (chatgpt, lamda, etc.).

c'est un adage bien connu, mais qu'il est bon de rappeler : si c'est gratuit (ou peu cher 😉 ) c'est que vous êtes le produit 😥

la plupart de ces applications requièrent une inscription nécessitant de nombreuses données personnelles, voire des photos.

je trouve ça inquiétant que personne ne relève les potentiels risques liés au fait de donner ouvertement ce genre d'information à des entreprises étrangères. pour rappel :
- lensa est édité par prisma ai, une entreprise américaine
- chatgpt est édité par openai, une entreprise américaine (qui n'a d'open que le nom... sauf erreur de ma part, le code de chatgpt n'est pas publique)
- dawn ai semble être fait par une entreprise du nom de splice video editor qui semble être une succursale américaine de bending spoons, une entreprise basée en italie (n'hésitez pas à corriger/compléter en commentaire sur ce point).

les exploitations et dérives possibles sont assez nombreuses (extraction d'information par secteur/pays, reconnaissance faciale, revente de données personnelles, etc.) et la prévention sur ce type de risque est finalement assez faible. sans oublier le fait que tous ces algos ont très certainement été entrainés sur des images/textes dont ils ne disposent absolument pas des droits, faisant fi de toutes les réglementations à ce niveau là 😅

enfin bref, en utilisant en masse ce genre d'application, nous ne faisons finalement que renforcer des entreprises qui ne respectent très certainement pas vos données, et donc votre vie privée 😉","why you shouldn't use chatgpt, lensa, dawn ai, etc. 👇

I have observed a real enthusiasm for several weeks for the various AI applications made public, whether at the image level (with for example lensa, dawn ai, midjourney etc.) or at the language level (chatgpt, lamda, etc.) .

it's a well-known adage, but it's worth remembering: if it's free (or inexpensive 😉 ) you are the product 😥

most of these applications require registration requiring a lot of personal data, even photos.

I find it worrying that no one has identified the potential risks associated with openly giving this kind of information to foreign companies. as a reminder :
- lensa is published by prisma ai, an american company
- chatgpt is published by openai, an American company (which only has open in name... unless I'm mistaken, the chatgpt code is not public)
- dawn ai seems to be made by a company called splice video editor which seems to be an american branch of bending spoons, a company based in italy (feel free to correct/complete in comment on this point).

the exploitations and possible abuses are quite numerous (extraction of information by sector/country, facial recognition, resale of personal data, etc.) and the prevention of this type of risk is ultimately quite weak. without forgetting the fact that all these algos have most certainly been trained on images/texts for which they have absolutely no rights, ignoring all the regulations at this level 😅

in short, by using this kind of application en masse, we end up only reinforcing companies that most certainly do not respect your data, and therefore your privacy 😉"

1948,"seit 2011 nutze ich evernote. 66.000 „notizen“ haben sich in meinem account angesammelt. nun wird dieses einst hoch gehandelte unternehmen von einem italienischen app-anbieter übernommen, von dem ich noch nie gehört habe (siehe unten). das macht mir natürlich sorgen.

einerseits gibt es alternativen. notesnook, obsidian und joplin werden immer wieder genannt. die werde ich mir natürlich anschauen. microsofts onenote wird zwar ebenfalls empfohlen. aber zum einen bin ich nicht so in microsofts universum investiert. zum anderen würde ich damit von einem proprietären angebot zum nächsten wechseln. da wären mir quelloffene anbieter, die außerdem auf formate wie markdown setzen, doch deutlich lieber.

andererseits ist die große frage, ob sich meine art der evernote-nutzung wirklich andernorts abbilden lässt. denn dass ich „notizen“ oben in anführungszeichen gesetzt habe, ist kein zufall. ich habe nicht wirklich 66.000 notizen angelegt. ich nutze evernote viel mehr als flexiblen, gut durchsuchbaren und schier endlos großen schuhkarton.

einige beispiele:

* dinge, die ich in feedly abspeichere, landen via ifttt automatisch in evernote.
* e-mails mit interessanten infos oder wichtigen anhängen leite ich direkt an evernote weiter.
* und überhaupt die e-mail-funktion: so habe ich newsletter abonniert, die direkt in evernote landen.
* ebenso geht die adresse für pressemitteilungen ans upload magazin direkt in meinen evernote-account.

zugleich sind es nicht nur diese funktionalitäten, die für mich den unterschied ausmachen. auch das preismodell ist anders: evernote gibt mir nicht den gesamtspeicherplatz vor, sondern wie viel ich pro monat hinzufügen kann. ich habe keine ahnung, wie viel speicherplatz meine 66.000 „notizen“ einnehmen. andere anbieter machen das wenig überraschend nicht so.

nun ja. ich werde mich da wohl umsehen müssen. falls ich umziehe, berichte ich. falls jemand von euch input, empfehlungen oder meinungen hat, freue ich mich.","I've been using evernote since 2011. 66,000 ""notes"" have accumulated in my account. now this once highly traded company is being taken over by an italian app provider i have never heard of (see below). of course that worries me.

on the one hand there are alternatives. notesnook, obsidian and joplin are mentioned again and again. I will of course look at it. Microsoft's onenote is also recommended. but for one thing, i'm not that invested in microsoft's universe. on the other hand, i would switch from one proprietary offer to the next. I would much prefer open source providers who also rely on formats such as markdown.

on the other hand, the big question is whether my way of using evernote can really be mapped elsewhere. because the fact that I put “notes” in quotation marks at the top is no coincidence. I haven't really created 66,000 notes. i use evernote much more as a flexible, easily searchable and almost infinitely large shoe box.

some examples:

* things that i save in feedly automatically end up in evernote via ifttt.
* I forward e-mails with interesting information or important attachments directly to evernote.
* and the e-mail function in general: i subscribed to newsletters that go directly to evernote.
* the address for press releases goes directly to the upload magazine in my evernote account.

at the same time, it's not just these functionalities that make the difference for me. the pricing model is also different: evernote doesn't tell me the total storage space, but rather how much I can add per month. i have no idea how much storage space my 66,000 “notes” are taking up. unsurprisingly, other providers don't do it that way.

Oh well. I'll have to look around there. If I move, I'll let you know. If any of you have input, recommendations or opinions, I'm happy."

we’re calling it “recruiting for good,” and here’s what we’ve learned:

there are a lot of big-hearted people out there who are happy to know they’ve brought something positive to the world. even if it’s something small. even if it doesn’t benefit them directly. even if it’s a result of a personal disappointment.

so we think we’ll keep the initiative going.

2041,"i clearly remember the feeling after completing two sets of tests (that meant a huge amount of hours of free work without talking to a single 'real person') and receiving a sort-of automated feedback that told me ""you've been good, nothing wrong on your tests but someone did better than you"". that's part of the game and that's okay.

the point is that i asked for specific feedback and i did not receive any. i thought that wasn't that nice but it could be understandable considering the high amount of applications you receive.

soon afterwards i discovered a friend of mine - who applied for the same position i applied - received the exact same email.
and then - which was the worst thing - the day after receiving my 'failure' email i discovered the same position had been reopened on linkedin.

i honestly think that the approach to candidates you have in the selection phase should be improved on top of any further initiative that involves recruiting.

it's nice to know something is done for the good but - in my opinion - it would be more respectful to have at least a personal feedback received after a huge amount of requested tests done by a candidate.","i clearly remember the feeling after completing two sets of tests (that meant a huge amount of hours of free work without talking to a single 'real person') and receiving a sort-of automated feedback that told me ""you've been good, nothing wrong on your tests but someone did better than you"". that's part of the game and that's okay.

around 70% participants were able to uncover more than 5 blockages which are stopping them from achieving their potential.

they also learned techniques to the blockages. as a demonstration most of them were able to bend steel spoons using these techniques.

2137,"ooops we broke rules at #bioasia 2014, details of #blunders

2014 february: #biotecnika & #rasayanika was invited to bioasia 2014, and we decided to promote our newly launched biotecnika magazine to all the attendees. we booked a stall at the conference, and 11 team members reached hyderabad 2 days before the start.

now here are the blunders we made:

- in my excitement, i booked tickets without looking at the dates, so on the day of my departure i realized that my flight ticket was booked from hyderabad to bangalore instead of bangalore to hyderabad; well, we got that fixed.

- the team reached with only 200 hard-copy magazines, but they realized that we needed 1000+ copies because we had so many fans reaching out to our stall; well, we sent more magazines from bangalore overnight. thanks to the travels buses which go every day from bangalore to hyderabad.

- day 1: we realized on day 1 of the conference that only 2 people from every stall were allowed to have free food as per the rules of the conference, and the remaining 9 had to go to the only nearby hotel, which was a 5-star hotel for lunch and that was a big oops because it cost us a bomb 25000+taxes for 10 people lunch

- day 2: instead of taking lunch in novotel, the entire biotecnika team decided to eat from the same plate, just that we went with our own personal spoons. we bent the rule a bit, but it was fun eating together 5 people from one plate each and then refilling it again. thankfully no one noticed

- day 3: we decided not to share food plates instead, we ordered kfc rice, but oops they forgot to deliver the gravy, once again we were eating with kfc rice and shared gravy from the conference buffet

finally, it all ended, and it was a huge success. i clearly remember how our team patiently explained to everyone who reached out to our stall on what is the concept of biotecnika and how we are helping youngsters get skilled and placed into the industry. it landed us many deals with some great companies who were looking for fresh ways to advertise and reach out to the young generation of biotech professionals.

now let's look at the blunders: yes, we did them, yes they all happened on subsequent days, yes it would have been a disaster, but we fought as a team and won.

whenever in life you face a series of blunders in a sequence, remember five things:

- you can fix everything
- you may sometimes have to bend the rules slightly
- when there are limited plates, rotate the plates, but dont go hungry or keep your team hungry
- mistakes don't define your accomplishments; you define your accomplishments
- your family & friends + biotecnika is your real team: reach out when in need. they will make you win.

ps: attaching a pic from bioasia 2014

2216,"after years of struggling to manage scope, i have come to realize that there is no such thing as scope.

instead, there is only understanding.

it reminds me of a scene in the matrix when neo went to visit the oracle and met a child who was bending spoons with his mind.

when neo asked how he did it, the child replied, ""do not try and bend the spoon. that's impossible. instead, only try to realize the truth...there is no spoon.""

in the same way, scope creep is not something that we can bend or control.

it is a symptom of a rigid approach to project management that tries to define and control every aspect of a project.

but the truth is, projects are complex, and understanding evolves over time.

we need to shift our focus from managing scope to managing understanding.

by adopting an agile mindset and committing to time and cost, we can allow our teams to adapt and evolve based on a deeper understanding of the project.

this approach requires a willingness to let go of our need for control and embrace the uncertainty and ambiguity of project management.

but in doing so, we can deliver better results for our customers and stakeholders.

so, let's take inspiration from the matrix and realize the truth about scope creep.

there is no scope, only understanding.

2298,"last week was the end of a journey that started more than 7 years ago when i joined the management team at evernote. with the recent acquisition by bending spoons, and the integration on track, it’s time for me to say good-bye and thank you!

to everyone at evernote. it’s been an absolute privilege to lead, learn and work along side you all these years. i look forward to the excellent things you will build on top of the foundation we set together!

to my product design & ux research teams, who stuck with it to transform an aging, fragmented user experience into one that is coherent, modern and ready for the future. best to all of you as you continue the mission to make evernote a better place to remember everything and accomplish anything!

to my colleagues on the leadership team, for being just plain great people and for the opportunity to learn so much from each of you, (especially my unmatched boss, ).

(lastly, but not least) to our amazing customers and community, for showing us all that evernote can do and for being the inspiration that made it worth working through the challenges.","last week was the end of a journey that started more than 7 years ago when i joined the management team at evernote. with the recent acquisition by bending spoons, and the integration on track, it’s time for me to say good-bye and thank you!

2305,"after 4 incredible years, my journey with evernote ended last week.

unfortunately, due to the bending spoons acquisition of evernote, my team was impacted.

the last few years have been nothing short of amazing. it was an honor to work alongside such a talented team, and i am beyond appreciative for every moment.

evernote will be missed but i am excited for what comes next. i'm currently looking for new opportunities in talent acquisition/technical recruiting.","after 4 incredible years, my journey with evernote ended last week.
